When Red Dawn came out, American leftists went ballistic because the movie portrayed their precious Soviet Union and Communist Cuba in a bad light. Those of us who lived during the Seventies and Sixties remember the absolute censorship that liberals had over the media and one of their iron clad rules was that no criticism of Communism, Cuba, or the Soviet Union was to be allowed to be aired. It was the perfect censorship. However, Red Dawn was not the first one; a couple of years prior to this a made for TV movie came out (""Amerika""), which was very, very badly made, but which worked on the same story line. But . . . since it was the first one to violate the Politically Correct restriction, well, the reaction against Red Dawn was nothing compared to the reaction to Amerika---the liberals went into hysterics. Ted Turner, one of Hollywood's limousine Communists (along with Hanoi Jane, Robert Redford and Warren Beatty) actively tried to kill the movie by having specials run at the same time slot for the purpose of indoctrination (read ""peace programs"" in PC jargon).

222367,6300216713,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,1,1,2012-07-01,Marathon Man is perhaps the best of the 1970's suspense thrillers with Nazi ties...,"Based on a novel by William Goldman, and directed by John Schlesinger, Marathon Man (1976) is a superlative thriller loaded with intrigue and deception, featuring a number of high tension action scenes, brutal torture, and a memorable villain with an ice-cold evil soul and a deadly trick up his sleeve.  The terrific story is brought to life by a marvelous cast, headed by Dustin Hoffman, Sir Laurence Oliver, Roy Scheider, William Devane, and Marthe Keller.  Some spoilers follow.The film opens in New York City, with two elderly men being killed in a traffic accident.  This incident triggers a sequence of events that brings a former Nazi named Christian Szell (Oliver) out of hiding in Uruguay.  A government agent named ""Doc"" Levy (Roy Scheider) is on his trail, looking to get his hands on a fortune in diamonds, that Szell has stashed in a safety deposit box in a New York bank.Thomas Babbington ""Babe"" Levy (Hoffman), Doc's kid brother, is a student at Columbia and a runner training for his first marathon.  Babe has recently begun a romance with a woman named Elsa (Keller), whom he met in a library.  The runner is suddenly drawn into a situation he has no knowledge of, when after being stabbed by Szell, a wounded Doc collapses at Babe's apartment and dies on the floor.A man named Janeway (Devane) arrives, claiming to work for a top secret branch of the government.  He informs Levy that his brother was also a government agent.  Janeway's prediction that Babe is in danger is correct, as he is abducted that night by Szell's henchmen, and taken to meet the former Auschwitz dentist, who asks the iconic question ""is it safe"", as probes and drills Levy's teeth.  Szell is eventually convinced that Levy knows nothing about his plans, and orders him killed, however Levy manages to escape, and must somehow find a way out of the situation.Marathon Man is not without flaws, but once matters reach a critical mass, events move so quickly, that there isn't much time to question what is happening.  After his escape, Levy doesn't contact the police.  Instead, when things finally calm down, he finds himself at a house in the country.  It's a strange detour that doesn't quite fit, as Levy has absolutely nothing to bargain with.In the city, Szell is visiting jewelry shops, looking for information about diamonds.  This doesn't seem to make that much sense either, however it sets the stage for ghosts from Szell's past to return, as he is recognized by some former death camp inmates.  The scenes are eerily effective, as Szell frantically scrambles to escape his past.Laurence Olivier's performance is magnificent, earning him a well deserved Oscar nomination.  At 69 and not in the best of health, there appeared to be physical limitations on what Olivier could do, yet the final confrontation scene with Levy in a pump station, is still quite dramatic and memorable.  Dustin Hoffman (The Graduate,Straw Dogs,Kramer vs. Kramer) is also outstanding, playing a man who has survived a trip to hell, sucking his teeth in pain as a reminder of the ordeal.  Although 39, the youthful looking Hoffman passes for a college student at the start of the film, however at the end, having been through the grinder, Hoffman very much looks his age.Roy Scheider (Jaws, The Seven Ups), and William Devane are also excellent.  Accomplished Swiss actress Marthe Keller, who did not speak English when she got the part, gives a remarkable performance in her American film debut.  She would soon become somewhat typecast, appearing in a string of thrillers includingBlack Sunday(1977),The Formula(1980), andThe Amateur(1981).The Nazi element was a popular theme in thrillers during the 1970's, and free of any political ties, it fits perfectly here, as it seems quite possible that a person like Szell could exist.  Most of the remaining story seems credible, and although there are some unknowns, matters come together pretty well, in what is one of the best thrillers of the decade.  The DVD contains some nice extras, including a relatively recent retrospective featurette.",5.0,1.0,6,2,0.6486,very positive,0.972,very positive,2012,7,1

642804,B00005JOSG,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,2,3,2006-07-25,"A truly wonderful, heartwarming, meaningful film","Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but, honestly, I don't see how anyone could give Last Holiday anything less than five stars.  This is a good, good movie through and through.  The story, the casting, and the settings are just dead-on, but it's Queen Latifah who really makes this movie special.  Who would have thought, all those years ago, that this young female rapper would someday absolutely light up the screen and connect with audiences in a way few actresses can match?  She's simply wonderful in the role of Georgia Byrd, a character that so many of us can identify with.  Georgia is ""just folks,"" a kind and caring woman who has spent her whole life waiting for something big to happen, too shy and afraid to do anything more than maintain a scrapbook of ""possibilities"" - places she wants to go, things she wants to do, and the man she wants to be with.  Just as she is beginning to come to terms with her suddenly thirty-something life, Fate comes up and punches her right in the mouth.  Not only is she dying of a rare disease, she only has three or four weeks to live.Rather than lie down and wait for death, Georgia decides to live her last days to the fullest.  Cashing in all of her assets, she jets off to the spectacular Grandhotel Pupp in Karlovy Vary (in the Czech Republic), where she lives like a queen in the Presidential Suite, dines in the restaurant of the famous Chef Didier (Gerard Depardieu), and embraces activities such as snowboarding and base jumping.  Almost immediately, she becomes the talk of the town.  Hotel staff marvel at such an obviously wealthy woman actually treating them with kindness and respect, while some of the other guests try to find out who she is and (in the case of a few) what she is up to.  Among those other guests are Matthew Kragen (Timothy Hutton), the owner of the retail store Georgia worked at (whose profits-only management style rubbed her entirely the wrong way - and didn't exactly boost profits, either), an important Congressman, and one of her own state's U.S. senators.  Along for the ride, as well, is the striking Alicia Witt as Kragen's mistress.  Last but not least is Sean Matthews (LL Cool J), Georgia's former co-worker and all-around man of her dreams, who comes to play a profound role of his own in Georgia's life.  As for Kragen, who really is a loathsome creature, he's suspicious of this nouveau riche stranger who seems to enchant everyone around him, from Chef Didier to the political cronies with whom he is trying to pave the way for a major new acquisition.  Suspecting her of trying to sabotage his pending deal, he sets out to prove that he is far more equal than she is.  All of these diverse characters' lives will be changed forever by Georgia's interaction with them.Last Holiday is a romance, drama, and comedy all rolled into one - and it has a unique effect on the viewer.  While the movie is genuinely funny throughout, the dark shadow of this wonderful character's impending death hangs over every shining moment.  Personally, the movie made me feel a little bit unsettled; I couldn't stand the thought of this wonderful character dying.  It isn't every movie that can make you laugh with a lump in your throat, but Last Holiday can make you do just that.  I give a lot of credit to the writers, as they tie every little plot element together beautifully.Those with a passion for the gourmet may be interested in knowing that all of the ritzy food dishes seen in this movie were prepared by chefs from the Food Network, and the recipes for each of the featured dishes were posted on the Food Network web site - I don't figure this Southern boy is going to get a hankerin' for Spiced Lamb Shanks with Blood Orange Relish any time soon, but I'll know where to look if the urge hits me.The important thing is that you watch this movie.  It doesn't just make you laugh or cry, it gives you a new appreciation for life and the inspiration to get off your duff and start living - and to treat others with respect while you're doing it.",5.0,0.6666666666666666,6,3,0.9001,very positive,0.9986,very positive,2006,7,25
966693,B000E1ZB9U,A6QMY5WPTVAT1,0,0,2012-04-23,A treat for John le Carr&eacute; fans,"I'm pretty sure that ""A Perfect Spy"" was the first John le Carr&eacute; novel I ever bought and read.  It had to have been at least twenty years ago, so my memory is a bit fuzzy; but I believe that this was my introduction to le Carr&eacute; in written form.  (I had previously seen at least a couple of movies and a TV miniseries based on some of le Carr&eacute;'s other novels; but this was the first one of his books that I actually read.)  Since then I have read most of John le Carr&eacute;'s other spy novels; and I consider myself a fan of his work.  But it's been a long, long time since I've read ""A Perfect Spy""; and I had forgotten most of the details of the story.  So, to be perfectly honest, I can't really say how closely this miniseries follows the plot of the book.  As I was watching it this past weekend, the characters and storyline seemed familiar, but only vaguely so.  Oddly enough, I never saw this miniseries when it aired on TV back in the early 1990s.  (It was a BBC production; but it was rebroadcast in the US as part of the PBS series ""Masterpiece Theatre"".)  In fact, I didn't even know that this miniseries existed until I came across the DVDs here on Amazon.  I'm glad I finally got to watch it.  (Better late than never, I suppose.)  As I said, I don't recall how closely it follows the book, but it definitely has the ""feel"" of a John le Carr&eacute; story; and, as a fan of le Carr&eacute;'s work, I found it quite satisfying.This seven-part miniseries tells the life story of Magnus Pym, the son of a con man who grows up to become a spy.  Beginning in Pym's early childhood, we see how his unusual upbringing shapes his character, turning him into a charming liar with no moral compass and a gift for getting people to trust him.  This is what ultimately makes Pym the perfect spy.  We watch Pym grow up and see how his unique life experiences ultimately lead him into espionage.  But we also see how the ghosts of his past affect the choices he makes in the present.  John le Carr&eacute; writes realistic spy stories that are complex, layered, and deep.  His stories are really about people, and why they do the things they do.  It just so happens that the people he writes about are spies.  They make interesting characters because they inhabit a shadowy world of secrets and lies, where the normal rules of moral behavior in a civilized society don't apply, and it's often hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys.  The thing that sets le Carr&eacute; apart from other writers of spy fiction is the way he captures, and subtly critiques, the moral ambiguity of the world of espionage.  He doesn't give us noble heroes and dastardly villains.  He simply gives us people -- realistically imperfect human beings -- all of whom are morally compromised in one way or another.  This is what we see in this miniseries.  If you're looking for mindless action in the style of James Bond or Jason Bourne, look elsewhere.  This miniseries is slow-paced and cerebral, with very little violence or action of any kind.  It's simply not that sort of spy story.  It's really not about the art of espionage at all.  Instead, it's an in-depth character study of Magnus Pym and why he did the things he did.  It's fascinating from a psychological standpoint; but anyone who watches this expecting it to be some sort of fast-paced thriller is likely to be bored to tears.  I should also point out that it does contain some brief nudity and strong language (though not a lot of it), which some viewers might not be comfortable with.If you're already a John le Carr&eacute; fan you should definitely get this.  If you're not already familiar with le Carr&eacute;'s works, several of which have been made into movies (including ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"", ""The Russia House"", and ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy""), then the only thing I can say is that I think it's a great story that's worth watching; but it's definitely not for everyone, especially those with short attention spans.",5.0,0.0,1,1,0.4019,positive,0.996,very positive,2012,4,23

Gore junkies rejoice, this series packs such a visceral punch it makes Claymore or Elfen Lied look like child's play.Seriously the amount of violence and gore and bloodletting in this series is on a level all its own. Pick up these two volumes ASAP, I spent full price and can say emphatically that it was worth every single cent. True Blood and Twilight had there throats ripped out by Hellsing long before they could even stand.Enjoy and don't forget to ""just drink the blood, you idiot.""",5.0,0.3333333333333333,1,1,0.0,neutral,0.969,very positive,2012,12,6

In GOYA'S GHOSTS he not only explores the multifaceted aspects of the great Spanish artist Francisco Goya as a painter of court portraits as well as canvases  of dramatic collisions between the factions of people versus military cruelty of 18th and 19th century Spain, but he also dissects the infamous Spanish Inquisition, not only by defining characters who represented the Holy Office and the victims of the 'purging' but also by subtly remarking on the tenor of the times by focusing on Goya's 80 etchings titled 'Los Caprichos'. This is a richly realized film that captures the horror of the times while it offers insights into the changes that occurred in Spain in a rather comprehensive fashion.1792 and while Francisco Goya (Stellan Skarsgrd) is painting portraits of the royal family (Randy Quaid and Blanca Portillo) as well as portraits of his favorite model In&eacute;s (Natalie Portman) and of the Inquisition activist Brother Lorenzo (Javier Bardem).  Corruption abounds  in Spain and the fear of the Inquisition headed by Father Gregorio (Michael Lonsdale) penetrates all of society. When In&eacute;s is called before the Inquisition because she doesn't like the taste of pork offered at a public banquet, she is tortured for not confessing to be a Jewess and imprisoned.  Despite the pleadings of Goya and the money offered by her family (Brother Lorenzo is asked to intervene on her behalf), In&eacute;s remains in prison for 15 years and when Brother Lorenzo visits her he impregnates her and the resulting girl child is sold upon her birth).  France invades Spain (courtesy of Napoleon Bonaparte) and when the French Revolution begins to spread through Europe the chastised Brother Lorenzo travels to France where he assumes a new life away from the church.  During the trauma of these years Goya loses his hearing and in response to the disintegration of society, creates the Caprichos - etchings that stress the brutality and madness to which the country has succumbed.  Lorenzo returns to Spain, the prisoners of the Inquisition are freed, and In&eacute;s (now pitifully ugly) searches for her daughter, confronting Lorenzo with the paternity. How all of the pieces of the Caprichos come to life brings an end to the story fills the final moments of this fine period piece.Javier Bardem is particularly strong in his role of the mutating Lorenzo and Stellan Skarsgrd makes Goya an understandable genius.  In addition to the named cast there are excellent cameo roles for such fine actors as Unax Ugalde, Wael Al Moubayed (Goya's interpreter), Jos&eacute; Luis G&oacute;mez and Mabel Rivera among others.  The cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe captures the flavor of the period and the musical score by Varhan Bauer and Jos&eacute; Nieto quotes some 20th century compositions (Shostakovich) and blends Spanish court and dance themes into a rich musical tapestry.  This is a fine film despite the lack of critical acceptance and certainly deserves a large audience, especially those who appreciate historical drama.

There are no cinematic effects in this Solti version, but neither is it a ""live"" production -- clearly, it was taped without an audience and then shots of the Covent Garden crowd were spliced in. That's probably just as well, as we get a minimum of interruptions for applause, but be warned if you are expecting a truly spontaneous performance.I can only echo what has already been said about Georghiu's performance. Unlike the vulnerable, barely-in-control Violetta of Teresa Stratas, she is a queen, commanding every scene she's in (which is most of them). She moves with graceful deliberation and sings with absolute authority. Lopardo is less persuasive as Alfredo -- maybe it's just that he squints too much to convince us that he's the ardent lover -- but the excellent overall direction masks any lack of acting skills. Indeed every bit of stage action in this performance seamlessly advances the story -- there is no sense, as there often is in opera, that the performers are being busy just for the sake of being busy.It's a pleasure to be able to say that all this technical proficiency does not diminish the emotional impact of the production. Maybe it doesn't quite get the three-hankie rating of Zeffirelli's version, but it certainly gets two, and it perhaps earns them a little more honestly.",5.0,1.0,1,3,0.0,neutral,0.9879,very positive,2006,7,4

However, brutal treatment (stomping on his hands) he received in the camp destroyed his ability to ever paint again.  The young boy rebels authority by his father as he just wants to be a kid like the others.  Father has dreams of him becoming a painter and forcefully engages the young boy into lessons.  Discovering one way to get out of painting, Xiangyang makes attempts to ruin his painting hand.The family endures an earthquake, and mother is all about making a home for her family, attempting to be on the list for an apartment that means resorting to a divorce until they get the apartment.  The story jumps to 1987 when Xiangyang meets a beautiful girl and paints her while she skates on the ice.  The relationship blooms, as he saves money to leave for Guangzhou with the girl and a friend, but again, father has control over him and forces him to stay to become the painter he never got to be.As Xiangyang becomes a young man in love, the conflict with his father continues as the parents go as far as insisting when Xiangyang and his,  presumably, wife must have a child.This is a wonderful compassionate film on father and son relationships, a universal theme, when the family imposes the best for their child; and especially, when a parent lives their dream through their child at the price of  natural tension, conflict and stress that comes with that.  But, it is a film about love; love for your family!The movie depicts the cultural changes in Beijing, changes in a family's life over thirty years.  The 70s scenes were shot in alleys, courtyards, unique housing and here is a nostalgic look at the children, simply at play.  The next scenes jumps to 1999 and we see how different society has changed.  This is a wonderful two hour family drama, saga, and a relationship with conflict.Don't miss the Special Features, discussion about how director Zhang Yang hopes people can come away with something from their own lives, some pieces of their own memories.  You will also learn how the title relates to the film's theme.  This is a two hour family saga filled with tense conflict and emotions.

I think it is because there was no real ""complete"" version available.  I thought Georgio Moroder deserved an ""A"" for effort (and a D- for his score) in putting together a longer version in the 80's, and Kino certainly deserves that grade for the most complete version that they put on video earlier in this decade.  However, because about 30-40 minutes was still missing, it still was not a true masterpiece to me;  a classic, yes, but not a masterpiece.When I heard about an almost complete version discovered in South America, I was very intrigued. but when I saw this version at the TCM Festival last spring, I was blown away by the power of the film and it finally made sense with so many little bits restored to the film.  We are still missing a few minutes, but with the exception of Joh Fredersen and Rotwang having a good, old-fashioned fight, whatever is still missing can be lived with.This is an astounding film, and Kino's HD transfer is remarkable, to say the least.  Image clarity ranks with their gorgeous copy of THE GENERAL, and even the battered found footage has been cleaned up enough to not take you out of the film when it appears.

I remember now how very much I enjoyed the movie when I saw it in the theater, and I still enjoy it even though I know about the ending, but I would not spoil your fun for anything. This is a genuine classic of film-making, a gem in your DVD collection. It also won seven Academy Awards, so I'm not the only one who loves it by any means.Paul Newman and Robert Redford play two con men who team up after Robert Shaw, as a slick New York mobster, killed Redford's former partner. His old partner recommended he look up Newman when he told him he was quitting -- just before he got killed.So Redford goes to look up Newman, and finds him sleeping off a drunk in the back of a merry-go-round place which has a whore house and gambling den upstairs. They plan a Big Sting on Shaw, involving several favorite character actors in the plan. The one thing that always amazed me about the big sting was how many people were involved, when the take was ""only"" half a million dollars. However, I suppose it's quite possible that in the 1930s, that was enough. Also, many of them were also looking for revenge for the death of Redford's former partner, whom most of them knew and liked.As I say, I won't spoil it by telling you about the sting, or what went right and what went wrong, because it's too much fun to watch it unfold. But I will suggest that once you've seen it through, go back and play it again, and see how many clues to the various sub-plots you missed while enjoying the excitement.

It was a completely Japanese-Stylized.

It seems an odd beginning but as we learn later, this would be the last or one of the last times George Wallace experienced any physical pleasure. The movie then begins a series of flashbacks and flash forwards of the life of this man who become such a lightning rod for the civil rights movement in America. He came to represent what so many saw as what was wrong with the South and their policies of segregation. Wallace's campaign slogan became 'segregation now, segreation tomorrow, segregation forever'. Was he a true racist or a populist who played the cards he thought would get him elected. He ran for governor of Alabama four times and for president four times. Many thought he had a serious chance to be elected President before the assassination attempt. This would have been the reverse of what happened in 2008, only 36 years earlier. Is this a summary of how far our country has come in the last four decades or was Wallace simply a political aberration? This is an outstanding film, the acting (especially Sinise) is terrific and it gives a balanced picture of this unusual politician. George Wallace is a very real part of American history and anyone under 40, especially, should watch this to understand why the subject of racism, while different than the 60's, has not gone away. There are actual archival scenes of civil rights protest mixed in the film. It is a three hour mini-series, not the 370 minutes it says on Netflix.

Less frequently noted are the remarkable performances of the ensemble cast, playing characters who fight to retain their integrity in the face of rising panic. Unlike the soapy 1950s Stanwyck version or the overblown James Cameron film of the 1990s, there are no easy endings for those who are trapped, no love recognized at the last moment or sustaining memories of brief shipboard happiness to float them forward through life: at the end there is only darkness and death--mitigated, sometimes nobly, by the human kindness and sacrifice.

511255,B00001QEE2,A2H7KX1BESUDEX,23,25,2000-06-03,Mandatory viewing for your son (or daughter),"Disney's grown up - to the point where each new animated release is sure to draw controversy and criticism from somebody; I personally was furious at the revisionism of Hunchback.  I forgave them when this movie came out.  Disney's Hercules is an experiment just like Fantasia, but many folks (it  appears), disliked the tampering with Greek myth as well as the unfamiliar  style and animation.  But I've got lots of reasons to make it my new  favorite Disney.  First, Disney (in an incredibly bold move) hired Gerald  Scarfe to design. His surreal yet powerful visions were always a highlight  of Pink Floyd concerts; now they break ground in the same way that Little  Mermaid did.  While many of the characters appear weird and sketchy, their  power seeps through every frame.  And, as always, nobody does villains like  Disney; Hades, Cerberus, the Titans, the whole Underworld - profoundly  frightening in a whole new way.  And Disney's forays into  computer-generated animation again stop the show when Hercules battles the  Hydra; even purists must agree to its power and brilliance.Then there's  the voice talent: James Woods predictably steals the show as Hades, whose  wisecracks do little to hide his genuine evil.  A close second is Danny  DeVito as Phil, a satyr who's saddled with training the young and awkward  Hercules to become a true hero; DeVito's given lots of jokes to tell, and  only diehard stodges will fail to bust a gut at some of his  remarks.Which leads us to the music: I went out and bought the  soundtrack because it was so good.  Led by the Muses (who are transformed  into the ultimate r&amp;b/gospel choir), the songs have a delightful mix of  50's do-wop (Susan Egan's absolutely beautiful  &quot;I Won't Say I'm in  Love&quot;), comedy (DeVito's &quot;One Last Hope&quot;), and classic  Disney uplift (Roger Bart as Hercules singing &quot;Go the Distance&quot;).  Disney staple Alan Menken teams with lyricist David Zippel to deliver yet  another brilliant soundtrack.But what has made the movie my personal  favorite is the message it has delivered to my three-year-old son; Disney's  given lots to the girls lately (most of Disney's recent heroes have been  heroines), but Hercules delivers the message that boys can grow up to be  heroes as well.  It's taught my son honor, generosity, and humor (well, I'd  like to think I helped a bit).  Hercules' journey from earthbound misfit to  man/godhood is truly inspiring.  My son thinks so, and so do I.By the  way, the special features enhance the DVD a great deal.  It's always a  pleasure to have the curtain pulled back to reveal the magic behind the  magic.Purists can just go to - well, the Underworld; Disney's Hercules  was meant to be innovative, but it did much more than break ground - it  taught my son a wonderful lesson.",5.0,0.92,1,1,0.0772,neutral,0.9982,very positive,2000,6,3

I'm 45 now, and I STILL, at least once or twice a year, have Zombie nightmares!: usually I'm climbing a tree, or a roof, or even flying, and the zombies are reaching up and grabbing at me, and sometimes actually touch me!  I wake up gasping!  This movie is THAT scary!  I'm a Christian, so I know that it couldn't really ever happen, but it's still fun to play ""What If?"" !  I HATED the zombies in 2004's remake; I mean, get real, zombies can't run!! They're DEAD! The zombies in THIS movie are just what they should be-slow, stupid, mean & HUNGRY!!  And TERRIFYING!!! The black zombie at the beginning, EATS his wife's neck and arm, and it's SO realistic and horrifying-looking and sounding! YIKES!!That's the hardest scene to watch. Steven, toward the end, made the BEST zombie I've ever seen!!! The way he dragged his foot, and the way he instinctively remembered where the upstairs room was, and the way he gnawed at the wall, was both hilarious AND terrifying!! I really hated what happened to Roger; he was the second-best Zombie defense they had, but he let his cocky-ness get the best of him, and he paid dearly for it.  But it was cool, the way he really did try not to come back, just like he told Peter. You could see him trying not to sit up! Also I LOVED the elevator zombie trying to crawl in, the baseball-player zombie that fell in love with Fran, the Hari-krishna zombie-all of them, I give them all 1000-thumbs up!

858771,B00064ADZC,A2CO0TBEGUZCZP,4,8,2005-02-12,JOE CASTRO RULES !!,"In my opinion, if most viewers talk trash about NEAR DEATH, it's because they `re not GOREHOUNDS and B MOVIES lovers in the first place.I mean, if you know a little about that culture, you know what JOE CASTRO is up to and that's GREAT CHEESE. I've been following that guy's career since TERROR TOONS and so far, he has never disappointed me.First of all, when it comes to eye-popping GORE FX, he's simply one of the best. Everything he's related to delivers the goodies. From gutting to crushing, you got it all.  Flicks like BLEED, ZOMBIE CHRONICLES and even BLOOD FEAST II would not be the same without his contribution. Yeah... He uses mostly mannequins and real meat for his FX. So what ? It's effective at best and funny at worse, so it's alright to me.I also think he's brilliant as a director. From Comedy ( TERROR TOONS )to Drama ( JACKHAMMER MASSACRE ), he can add anything to his gory formula. He's always creative and daring. He also knows how to use his money : give him the last blockbuster's cappuccino's budget and he shoots a CULT flick in 2 days or less. I'm not kidding, the guy is that good. He got his own touch, naive and wicked at the same time and it's everything but boring. Maybe the production values are not always there but then again : if you can't stand Low budget HORROR flicks, maybe you should stick to Hollywood's major releases. But if you like your stuff bloody, dirty and sleazy, like I do, then JOE CASTRO is a dude you can trust.Now... About NEAR DEATH itself : it's a story of ghouls and ghosts. To be more precise, the plot is about three students of the paranormal who chase the spirit of a dead director into a big old house where strange and hostile people live. Enough said . You got cannibalism, dead, naked babes and of course : blood and guts. That's not it, since it Deals with ghosts of the 1940's, NEAR DEATH is more classical than previous JOE 's efforts in terms of setting and dressing. The house they use is great, spooky and weird and it adds a lot to the general atmosphere. The cast is almost the same than in BUTCHERED and MANIACAL, other great stuff that JOE CASTRO shot around the same time, and it's cool too.What more can I say ? GOREHOUNDS, don't let the haters fool you, NEAR DEATH is what you're looking for.And now a litle message to that sinister fool who pretends to be the master of HORROR... By comparing NEAR DEATH, a quikie shot in two days with no money, to ultimate classics like EVIL DEAD or BAD TASTE, who took years in the making and costed WAY more  money than this flick, you only prove one thing : you don't know what you're talking about.

377061,630347327X,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,3,3,2002-03-21,A Wellesian film that Welles didn't direct,"Reportedly Orson Welles replied to people who asked if he'd ""really"" directed The Third Man that Carol Reed didn't need his suggestions. Yet this feels very much like Welles in many ways. First of all there's the subject matter--like Citizen Kane, this film deals with money and power, shattered idealism, and an elusive figure everyone knows *of* yet few people know. Like Kane, the cinematography is striking (though in a different way) and an integral part of the plot. Like Kane, the music is memorable and tells much of the story, yet again in a different way. Like Kane, the film was greeted coldly by many critics on its initial release and had to be shelved for many years before people realized it was a masterpiece. And last but not least, like Kane, it stars the great Joseph Cotten.The Third Man benefits enormously from being shot in post-war Vienna (in record time by using three crews simultaneously). You can taste the atmosphere. The locations are a ""star"" as much as any of the human players. Selznick wanted Reed to film on Hollywood back lots, and he wanted Jimmy Stewart to star. He objected to the zither music. He objected to the canted shots. (William Wyler reportedly gave Reed a level to put on his camera after seeing The Third Man!) Most of all, Selznick wanted a happy ending, where Holly gets the girl. But without Reed's vision, the film would have been a typical glossy Hollywood film now seen at 2 am on local UHF channels if at all.Reed gave Welles one of the great entrances in screen history. Welles gave Reed a hard time by refusing to work in a sewer and returning to England, forcing Reed to build a sewer set there just for Welles' part. Welles says he only wrote the ""Cuckcoo clock speech,"" but leave it to Orson to give us the most memorable dialogue in a movie filled with memorable dialogue.Then there is the issue of The Woman. Often she will make or break a film like this, and here Alida Valli (or ""Valli"" as she preferred to be billed in the film...maybe it's an Italian thing that started long before Madonna) is the perfect choice, brooding and un-glamorous and yet all the more alluring because she's un-glamorous. It's easy to see how impressionable Holly would fall for her. It's harder to see why she would still defend Harry, but love is not always logical. Or is this just selfishness? There doesn't seem to be room for love in Reed and Greene's postwar Vienna...Criterion has done a loving restoration of The Third Man, superb considering how poorly prints of this film have been handled over the years. Criterion performed many computer-repairs of tears and splices that make once-damaged scenes play perfectly. (So many prints of this film are stark and grainy black and white and nearly unwatchable.) There are some extras, such as footage of Anton Karas performing on his unique instrument, documentary footage of the real Vienna sewers, the original trailer, the rerelease trailer, the alternate American opening, and fascinating production photos and commentary.

Now Even Better in Blu-Ray!,"Calling this the best ever family entertainment flick is no hype or exaggeration.  Just as it happened way back 70 years ago, trying to keep up with Disney's ""Snow White"" has been a blessing for fans as now after ""Snow White""'s Platinum Edition treatment which included DTS and Dolby 5.1 audio enhancements plus visual restoration, we get a similar treatment unfortunately without the DTS option and yet I had to struggle for the first half hour to try and find any visual imperfections to this restoration but I had to give up as I could find none!  The visual effects, especially the tornado scenes still amaze me at just what they were capable of special effects-wise all those years ago.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 surround was a real plus for me and went a long way in bringing this all-time classic into the 21st century.  If it's so good already, I can only imagine how much better the Blu-ray version would be and I await the day of that release with bated breath!  Like a true classic, this movie has aged very, very well and has passed the test of time.  Whoever did the casting should have received an Oscar as I thought all the actors did very, very well.  Judy Garland was perfect for the role of Dorothy and Bert Laer was excellent in his role as the Cowardly Lion.The Special Features deserve honorable mention as well; we get a great behind-the-scenes documentary narrated by Angela Lansbury who also did something similar for the ""Snow White"" restoration dvd as well.  There's also a History of Oz, Deleted Scenes and many interviews with the cast.  Every child should have a chance to see this film and with all the great restoration work that has been done on this dvd, there is no other perfect time to get this dvd.  This a without doubt one of the best ever movies ever made.Very highly recommended!Updated 20 April 2011:Amazon doesn't allow me to review this separately and so I have to do this here.  The blu-ray version of this film is simply excellent!  After watching the dvd which was already very good, I am amazed at how much better this film looks on 1080p!  It also sounds very good and this blu-ray is certainly worth the upgrade from the dvd.Very, very highly recommended!",5.0,1.0,2,6,0.5399,positive,0.9991,very positive,2008,2,25

Sounds like your typical Reese Witherspoon role, eh? No, not by a long shot.But one thing about her role -- she is fantastic, out of this world great. She is twice the actress in this role she was playing June Carter Cash, for which she won an Oscar as best actress. On the basis of these roles, Witherspoon must be considered one of the best actresses extant right now.As the description here and on Amazon indicates, this movie presses the envelope of the ""R"" rating as far as possible without slipping over into NC-17. There is gory, bloody violence throughout this film, nudity and more ""F"" and ""F""ing talk than you heard by Matt Damon when he played that low-class genius at Harvard. Someone told me they said ""F"" 147 times in that movie. Witherspoon herself must say it that many times here.But none of this diminishes the astonishing electricity and action that swallows the viewer right from the opening scene, where junkie-hooker mom gets arrested and weirdo-junkie stepdad forces Reese to do the nasty while mom's out earning a living. There is an uncompromising level of reality in these characterization, too, although it's clearly an over the top psycho young Sutherland plays.In an astonishing bit of casting, squeeky clean prom queen type Brooke Shields is cast as the uptight, upscale wife to lurid pervent and child molester Sutherland, whose character is even more disgusting than Witherspoon's. While everyone wants Sutherland rubbed out, Witherspoon manages to keep viewer sympathy because of for her terrible place in life even throughout her ongoing antisocial activities. Other players, incluidng Dan Hedaya as a cop with sympathies all over the place, contribute a lot to this film.This is recommended for viewers unafraid to look inside the dark side of our culture where youngsters like the one Witherspoon plays actually exist. There is nothing pretty or orderly about this movie; much of it seems upside down. But it is unrelentingly exciting and is full of action in almost every scene, action you may never have seen in a film before.",5.0,0.8888888888888888,3,1,0.0,neutral,0.6538,very positive,2006,11,5

1366785,B003VA3JSG,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,3,3,2013-08-11,Rough,"A Call Girl is a rough adult drama that looks at alienation, what are reality and truth, and the effects of post communist Eastern Europe on a young woman.A Call Girl is a difficult movie. The opening montage is of a beautiful young woman discreetly going to a hotel room. It quickly becomes clear she is an independent escort. Because she is beautiful and seemingly innocent, I wanted her to succeed, to have good things happen to her. She ultimately steals money from the man. This is the central premise of the film; things aren't always as they appear. In a country where everybody was guaranteed a living no matter what job they did, capitalism completely changed the rules. Beautiful, well-meaning people now found themselves in a position where they had to do anything to make a living. It turns out that Sasha, the young woman, never tells the truth to anybody. She lies to get what she wants. The part of this movie that is so uncomfortable, she is convincing with those lies and I wanted her to get whatever she asked for.Some horrible things happen to Sasha. There are moments where I wish I hadn't seen that moment, and you can't undo that visual. Some of those horrible things are Sasha's own making, others are bad things just happened to her by no fault of her own. There is a bright side to the film; her father loves her more than anything in the world. Even to the extent that he talks with one of his friends about committing suicide, and says he couldn't ever do it because of his daughter.I couldn't stop watching this film. It is a brilliant view of a culture I could never know. The things that had to happen in that country to drive people to do what they have for money are impossible to imagine. Although Sasha was ashamed to tell her friends and father about what she did for money, that never stopped her from continuing, even when her life was threatened. This appears to be a metaphor for what is happening in Slovenia, people will do anything to survive or get ahead.This is a beautifully acted film. I loved the performances of the two central characters, Sasha and her father. The editing was interesting and forced me to watch carefully, sometimes a single cut would move time forward a few days, and others only an hour. The director did an excellent job making those jumps clear. The film is presented in various languages with subtitles. There are critical dramatic moments when Sasha speaks English or Slovene.The film is not rated. It is very much an adult film. There are several sex scenes, one fairly rough. These scenes are important dramatically and fit perfectly with the story line - there is nothing obscene about any of them. There is a lot of strong language. And of course the film deals with the subject of prostitution. There is a horrifying scene where somebody is almost thrown off a balcony. This is an adult film.I loved this film. It turned preconceived notions upside down for me. This was a complicated hour and a half film. One that I could not stop watching and enjoyed immensely. I have to admit, I didn't completely understand the film, and I just know I loved it.Film Movement includes an eighteen-minute short, Honored, on the DVD. This short fit perfectly with A Call Girl, it is an odd wrestling with alienation, and lies. I'm not sure I cared much for this film. It started off reasonably well. It then went into this really strange habit of people constantly leaving the room they were in. Of the eighteen minutes, I think ten were spent with people moving from one room to another and not being on camera anymore. It seemed quirky at first, and an odd thing to do. But after the 12th time somebody moved to a different room, I was tired of the effect. There are only two characters in the film, and it takes place in a house with a porch, a kitchen, and a living room. Yeah, there was no reason for these two people to move so much. The story is about a soldier bringing letters back to his friend's widow.",5.0,1.0,2,1,0.0,neutral,0.9515,very positive,2013,8,11

These two men are inexorably tied by some greater notion that color does not really matter, yet they were inexorably different cast into this world by their cultural differences. That is what makes this film so great. Norman Jewison is a brilliant director. He first and foremost knows how to tackle a story thematically and at the same time entertain you. He is a master storyteller where every element of a film is somehow integrated into an all encompassing single tale touching all our senses in the process. As for Sidney Poitier, this is his film .

The first half is brilliant and those episodes are the greatest of the entire series. In my view the introduction of Lex Luthor in a double episode ruined the season to a degree but I still rate it with the five stars it deserves. That double episode and the 2 that followed were stupid in my book and much worse than those before them and those that followed. I don't want to explain what happens as some who read this may not know what I am refering to. But the first 12-14 episodes were of high quality as were the final episodes of the season. The main storyline during this third season is the romantic relationship between Lois and Clark and the chemistry between Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher was better than ever in season 3. Their obvious chemistry and working relationship is the reason why I think season 3 is the greatest of them all. You truly believe they are in love - the only two actors to accomplish that in my opinion. The only minus is the above mentioned episodes regarding Lex Luthor. The show had moved on beyond Lex and it was a bad move to return to Lex. I can guarantee that anybody that likes Superman will love season 3 but this season is more about the love between Clark and Lois than the reporters Clark and Lois. Nevertheless there are several episodes that show the reporters doing what they do best. Finally I want to repeat that this is the greatest season of Lois and Clark. Season 1 was good, season 2 was very good but season 3 is excellent. I highly recommend this season of Lois and Clark.",5.0,0.6666666666666666,1,1,0.6369,very positive,0.997,very positive,2006,8,2

This crazy cool science fiction film is one of the most astounding, violent - and weird - movies of the year.2. The opening credits frontload the story: In 2014, in order to combat global warming, a chemical was released into the atmosphere to cool the temperature a few degrees. Only it went too far and the planet froze. The only survivors are a few thousand people on a train that continuously circles the globe. The train is divided according to class structure, with the richest people living in the head of the train, and the poorest living in the tail.3. The movie opens by dropping you onto the train in the year 2031, and lets you figure out the rest of what&#8217;s going on by yourself. It gives you the broad strokes, but you have to do some work to figure out some of the details.4. The main focus of the movie is a revolution by the poor people to advance and take over the head of the train. But as the class warfare escalates, you learn more of the secrets about the train. The story slowly spins outward to encompass a lot of issues and ideas.5. The movie balances humor, anxiety, fear, chaos, and horror, and places it all on a moving train that nobody can leave. It is a lot darker and more violent than I expected.6. The mood is lightened a few times by some really weird humor that feels out of place with the rest of the movie, but it&#8217;s well done, so you just go with it.7.  The acting is uniformly great. This is easily the best performance I&#8217;ve seen by Chris Evans. I didn&#8217;t know he could actually act, but I totally forgive him for being Captain America now. And while Tilda Swinton has never given a bad performance, she is deliciously deranged in this movie. This will go down as one of her more memorable roles.8. Being directed by a South Korean director, the movie was released last year in South Korea, where it broke box-office records. But the American studio releasing the film wanted some changes to make it less weird, not as dark, and easier to understand. The director refused, and there was a battle over the control of the film. The director won, and the movie was released in its original form, although just in a small amount of theaters.9. Not everyone is going to like this movie. It&#8217;s pretty strange. It&#8217;s political, psychological, and philosophical. There&#8217;s a high body count. It&#8217;s both thought-provoking and gut-wrenching. But if you want a science fiction film that is the exact opposite of blockbusters like &#8220;Transformers&#8221;, then this is what you want to see.",5.0,0.7777777777777778,2,1,0.0,neutral,0.9178,very positive,2014,7,6

1117146,B000YABIQ6,A3C1Q9TRP83BYB,2,3,2008-10-22,The Eisenhower Era Revisited,"After watching the first few episodes of ""Mad Men"", you can be forgiven if your eyes burn and you start to cough. It might be the only television show in history to cause second-hand smoke. Set in 1960, ""Men Mad"" is really about the 1950's and it captures the spiritual emptiness of the period perfectly. While the Eisenhower era has been romanticized recently as a wonderful time when all Americans had jobs, homes, and cars (and when Republicans were considered ""nice"" people believing in thrift) this fantasy is true only if you were a straight, white male. And a conforming one at that. Still, the emotion that pervades this series is sadness: no one is happy, no matter how many material goodies they have. Even the beatniks are gloomy and dull.The men survive by chain-smoking, drinking themselves insensible and attempting to seduce anything in a skirt. The women are treated to such casual and pervasive sexism that, viewing ""Mad Men"", even conservative women like Phylliss Schlafly will send Gloria Steinem a fruit basket. The women themselves are either the original ""Desperate Housewives"" or trying to stay sane by manipulating the men who prey on them. People of color exist merely as waiters and elevator operators. In the world of 1960 advertising, they are completely non-existent. You see no ads depicting a black or Hispanic family buying a new car, sharing a beer with friends or ogling a new refrigerator. Nor will you for another decade.Centering around the advertising executives of the fictional Sterling-Cooper agency (""Mad Men"" is slang for the admen working on Madison Avenue in New York City, the archetypal Men in the Gray Flannel Suits), ""Mad Men"" succeeds more from mood then plot. The action is focused on the nuances of facial expression that speaks louder than words at a time when true self-expression was unknown and unwanted. The plot itself centers on rising adman star Don Draper (Jon Hamm), who has a secret past and his relationship with his suppressed wife, Betty (January Jones) who, although in therapy, is treated like a dependent child by her analyst who discusses her case only with her husband, not her. Elisabeth Moss shines as Peggy Olson, Draper's new secretary who is ahead of her time in terms of sexual liberation and professional intelligence. When she finally writes copy for a successful ad campaign (unheard of for the women in the office) she is condescendingly offered a drink, a pat on the back but no pay or no position. She chafes under her treatment and one wonders what the coming of the tumultuous Sixies has in store for her.Which bring us to the children of the principal characters. All those cute little tykes running around with cowboy hats and cap guns will, within the coming decade, become hippies, anti-war protesters, feminists and environmental activists. Bob Dylan is still a year away from descending upon the scene but if there ever was a time that needed a'changing, it was 1960 America. The Beatles, Vietnam, and Kennedy's assassination are just around the corner but no one at Sterling-Cooper knows this or even has the imagination to envision the cataclysmic changes about to descend upon them. And when they do happen, will they notice or care?",5.0,0.6666666666666666,2,1,0.0,neutral,0.2617,positive,2008,10,22

Be warned now that some slight spoilers are ahead here.  The fifth, and penultimate, season of Lost begins with Jack (Matthew Fox), Kate (Evangeline Lilly), Sayid (Naveen Andrews), Hurley (Jorge Garcia), and Sun (Yunjin Kim) slowly realizing that they must return to the island with Ben (Michael Emerson) at the behest of the mysterious Eloise Hawking (Brotherhood's Fionnula Flanagan).  In the meantime back on the island, Sawyer (Josh Holloway), Juliet (Elizabeth Mitchell), Faraday (Jeremy Davies), Miles (Ken Leung), and Charlotte (Rebecca Mader) find themselves, and the island itself, stuck traveling through time, which leads to some very interesting developments during the three years that Jack and co. are gone from the island.  We also witness just how Locke (Terry O'Quinn) wound up in that coffin in the first place, and how it ties into the return of the Oceanic Six to the island, as well as learn the fate of Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), and see what Desmond (Henry Ian Cusick) has been up to.  Most notable however is that we finally learn more about the island's checkered past, from the huge foot of the missing statue to getting an understanding of the never-aging Richard Alpert's (Nestor Carbonell) actions to finally getting a glimpse of Jacob in the epic and shattering two part season finale that promises everything will change.  With everything that happens this season and how Lost now deals with time travel and the consequences it creates, you'd think things may end up convoluted and confusing, but surprisingly so, Lost manages to maintain a straightforward narrative that if you've been following the show for any amount of time at all, won't get thrown off or confused in the very least, which in itself is quite an accomplishment.  Yes, the end of Lost is upon us, and like past seasons before, many questions were answered, but in one huge flash of white light, even more were raised.  The end is indeed near, and while I certainly don't want to wait until 2010 to see how everything gets wrapped up, I have a feeling that the best is yet to come.",5.0,0.7692307692307693,10,1,0.4404,positive,0.9517,very positive,2009,5,15

And what a grand film they created.  Flowingly cinematic, with stunning location filming and superb cinematography the many cuts allow for a smooth narration without sacrificing the gut and heart of the play.There was much controversy when this film debuted, probably due to it being financed and produced by Hugh Hefner and Playboy, and probably because it was unblinkingly bloody upfront (although the blood is in the play, much of it is naturally offstage), and because of nudity in several key scenes (including the witches....all those old nude crones, while factually correct, no doubt upset many).  Today, these seem like perfectly reasonable choices.  The film is relentless and remorseless, as befits the story.  I don't know what part of Polanski's personal tragedy had any part in his work here, but the direction is excellent.  Finch and Anis are fine as the murderous Laird and his Lady, as is the rest of the cast.If you want the play, see the play.

The books are more complete and informative and tell stories about life that is not experienced by most people. The books can tell you why certain things are done, the films only show you what happened. The books tell you about ""ropers"", rough or smooth shadows, and how to evade surveillance and avoid leaving a back trail. Some may question the legality and ethics of Perry Mason's tactics but most stories were written before the modern legal rules of the 1960s. The backgrounds tell about life in Los Angeles. It is difficult to film a scene at night but easy to describe it in a book. Erle Stanley Gardner was the founder of the ""Court of Last Resort"" which sought to free many unjustly convicted persons. Gardner, among others, sought to use scientific means to find the guilty, rather than using hunches or guesses alone.The seeming reality of these stories is due in part to characters who don't look like Hollywood actors. The theme music is typical for that era. Note the style of clothing and culture; ladies wore white gloves. People seldom lock their doors. The prices date these films. One advantage is seeing the many automobiles from the late 1950s. How many can you identify? Note the slimness of people, the smoking, and the familiarity with pistols. Watch how the actors express their emotions by their facial expressions. The camera sharpness and quality is excellent on these films.. There is nothing like these dramatic stories on today's broadcast TV. When was the last time you saw a trial lawyer as a hero?

I argued what I could write, how I might approach the very fact that the comedy in some of these episodes were at the expense of a nation of people struggling to be recognized as equals. The black face and slow-speaking, from-the-poorhouse drawl is very unsettling to some. Others brush it off, that it was a product of its time, like Amos and Andy. Well, Amos/Andy isn't the world we live in, and I respect those who don't like the characterizations portrayed in some of these episodes.Being 48 years old at the time of this review, I grew up watching these on Saturday mornings, on the UHF channels. They looked much classier than Popeye and Bugs Bunny. I saw a sophistication in these early Tom and Jerry shorts, because of the care into the detail of the characters, but also in the depth of detail and subtle and refined work put in to the backgrounds. The shading and color is remarkable. This wasn't computer-generated, but hand-drawn cells, frame by frame. It is purely exquisite viewing, with sensitivity sketched and colored into the storytelling for episodes such as Night Before Christmas, Mouse in Manhattan, and Cat Concerto.Mouse in Manhattan displays storytelling with a heart; but all of these shorts from the classic years have a real fun to them. I do bristle when I see the stereotyping displayed as comedy, but it's simply cemented into what was created in that era, when Blacks couldn't share the same bathrooms or stay in fine hotels, or eat at the same restaurant as Whites.I have struggled to push the play button to watch the film, ""Birth of a Nation"" (1915), but it's in my film library, because it is a breakthrough film with regards to shooting style, storytelling and composition. I have it, because it was also made in an era even worse for wear by being created 30 years prior to the Tom and Jerry classics.Why did I give it five stars, even with the things I wrote above? Because this is still the benchmark of animation done right, well, and the way it should be. I really think these shorts will hold their own - the same as the true classic hand-drawn Walt Disney features - against the CGI films, like those made by Pixar and DreamWorks. I wouldn't dare say they're better, or not as good; it would be just as silly as comparing Johnny Unitas to Peyton Manning.But, I'm glad that the rights owners chose to restore each episode in their original states, and not try to re-dub or trim out some of the offending moments. Being Black, I don't take offense to those scenes, but I wouldn't want to watch them in mixed company.

638404,B00005JO20,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,3,5,2005-12-15,A Masterpiece,"When King Kong was first released in the 1930s, people hadn't seen anything like it before.  It was a technical marvel that thrilled and chilled audiences across the nation.  In fact, some of the scenes were deemed too scary for the audience (the now famous spider sequence) and were cut.  Now, in 2005, Peter Jackson has once again shown why he is the king of the epic film by recreating pretty damn faithfully the original experience but doing something even more wonderful:  adding heart and humanity.The original King Kong was a fiercesome beast.  From ripping heads off with disdain, ripping wings, destroying everything he touches, Kong was more monster than anything.  Sure he had an affection for Fay Wraye's character and at the end you do feel sorry for him.  But what was missing from his leering, toothy gaze was the heart that Jackson has found.  There are scenes of such humanity between Ann Darrow and Kong that you can almost forget he is a 25 foot Gorilla.  From the beginning when Ann performs Vaudeville prat falls to keep Kong from killing her to the sentimental (almost too much? But definitely needed) scene in the park, Kong is shown as a creature that can love, can feel and can be more human than monster.  You get a sense near the end that Kong has learned.  His character has progressed from the beginning.  And that makes what happens next all the more tragic and heart-breaking.Andy Serkis who did terrific work as Gollum once again goes above and beyond in his duty as Kong.  Having studied gorillas in the habitat (involving a much maligned trip to Africa that Peter begged him not to do for safety reasons) Serkis nails Kong's behaviour patterns and thought process.  Between him and the best CG I've seen, King Kong is a beast with sadness.  You can see it in his eyes and his movements.  Perfect.King Kong is long.  At 3 hours it is about double the original film.  How is this possible?  Well, there's more character development.  The first act is comprised of the adventurers actually reaching the island and concerns itself with developing the myriad of characters on the boat.  It also expresses the possible love that could blossom between Ann and Jack before Kong steps into the picture.  I'll admit, the first act was a bit over-long.  It was important to the film, but it got the point where I wanted something exciting to happen.Once that exciting moment happens, though, the thrill ride begins.  What follows once they reach the island is thrilling sequence after sequence.  But unlike other movies involving dinosaurs (Jurassic Park 3), this film has emotion, characters worth caring about and heart.I can't recommend this movie enough.  It does everything a remake should.  It is faithful to the original but builds upon it both creatively and technically.  You will laugh, you will jump and you will possibly cry at this story of beauty and the beast.A must see.",5.0,0.6,2,9,0.6249,very positive,0.9973,very positive,2005,12,15

How can you go wrong? I remember watching this the first time and liking it, but feeling that it lacked cohesion. It does take awhile for the Kundun to mature to an adult so we can identify with him and care about him.But now I look at the film as being almost two separate parts. The first half shows us the Dali Lama as a child who must take on the role of Kundun and gives us a very slow (and beautiful) sense of environment and atmosphere. It also quietly sets up characters that will grow in importance as the film continues. The second ""adult half"" of the movie focuses on the Kundun having to deal with an aggressive communist China closing in on him and his people.I feel like many people (including Ebert who said this is the only Scorsese movie he would not want to see again...) watch it once and say it was slow and they didn't care about the Dali Lama character enough. Well if you only watch it once you won't be able to see the detail (like the shot of the Kundun looking at Mao's shoes, or the baby Kundun separating the fighting beetles) , and depth that make up the fabric of this movie. There are all kinds of great shots and quick edits (the 3 seconds of violence in this film are more powerful then the lengthened violence in other films), and symbolism that you simply can't get your mind around the first time you watch this movie. Having said all of that, the cinematography alone would make this movie worth getting. And at $10, you make out like a bandit.",5.0,0.918918918918919,1,1,0.0,neutral,0.9721,very positive,2005,8,28

Imagine Grimm's Fairy Tales, 200 years on and everything is not Happy Ever After anymore.Virginia and her father, Tony, (from New York) pass  through a magic mirror to aid Prince Wendall, who's been turned into a dog  by an evil Queen.  They are joined and guided on their journey by Wolf who  is half-man, half-wolf.  Initially controlled by the Queen, Wolf changes  his alliance when he's meets Virginia and falls in love with her.The  adventure is fantastic, along with the effects.  Each character is  carefully drawn and essentially the movie is about each of them finding  themselves and then each other.Virginia starts out cold and in tight  control of her emotions, resenting that her mother left her when she was  young. Wolf eventually manages to break through her defence with his  passion and enjoyment of life.Tony starts out a whining coward but ends  up a hero.Prince Wendall starts out spoilt and a snob but by the time  he's restored to human form, he's a wiser man.And Wolf, well, he's a  tortured soul that wants to be good and due to his love for Virginia he  finally manages to overcome his wolfish side - although, thankfully, not  totally!To explain Wolf's dilema it's easier to quote him. While talking  to a therapist about Virginia he says: &quot;I've met a girl that I really,  really like but I don't know whether I want to love her or eat  her.&quot;Scott Cohen who plays Wolf definitely steals every scene he's  in but having said that, the other actors are excellent too and they all  work well together.Lastly, I just wanted to mention Rutger Hauer who  plays the Huntsman.  It's another great baddie role for him and he is just  wonderful - he has such quiet menace!Watch it - it may be long but  you'll be 'wishing on a star' to see it again and again!",5.0,1.0,2,1,0.6114,very positive,0.9954,very positive,2000,5,4

1030236,B000K2UGXO,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,2,2,2008-12-31,Excellent,"It may be that judgment colored the comments of most reviewers but whatever colored them, the negative comments are washed away by superb acting and an overwhelmingly fine presentation of a place, era, and way of thinking probably foreign to most viewers, even from the U.S.Very possibly, as reviewer El Lagarto points out, a central problem is also ""the iconic nature of the source material,"" namely, the biography of corrupt populist Louisiana governor, Huey ""Kingfish"" Long---the man who called himself a ""hick"" and rose up by addressing other ""hicks""---many of whom had never voted before. I blush to tell, I've never read the famed Robert Penn Warren novel on which this film is based.But the movie perfectly captures the oppressively hot, humid Louisiana climate, along with the perennially corrupt political environment that endured throughout the 20th century and into our own era. It also precisely frames the grand antebellum plantation houses, wide lawns, live oak-lined dirt drives and swamps of south Louisiana, where the population is concentrated---along with the decadence for which New Orleans, from its very establishment, has always been deservedly renowned.The Willie Stark that Sean Penn manufactures is a Huey Long-look alike, and is totally believable. He has the accent, the swagger, and the deep south dead pan down cold, along with the ability to spin a highly colorful yarn based on a highly colorful southern analogy. There's no modern politics in this part. It's late 1920s and early 1930s Louisiana, the whole way. In context.That's undoubtedly another problem for most viewers. The environment established so firmly in this amazing political story is that it is so foreign to that of current-day U.S. population centers. Apparently,  few people can believe that anything like it ever existed in the U.S. But Louisiana has always been something of a world unto itself, and this was especially true during the Huey Long era.The actors, listed above, all contribute to the full-scale replication of that complex world, where a gentleman's honor and appearance account for almost everything. Most of the main characters (good guys and bad, alike) thus live beyond the reach of morality---power-hungry, afflicted with alcoholism, or eternally laboring to hide their personal shame or dirty laundry.This film's negative reception was totally unwarranted. Overall, it's an amazing dramatic accomplishment. For more than two hours, the movie held us rapt in another time, and a thoroughly fascinating place.--Alyssa A.

My mother says that Edward represents anyone who can be considered ""different"". A lot of people think that the point of the movie is to display the way people will love something one second and hate it the next. I had a teacher once who told me it was about what it's liked to be loved for the things you do but hated as a person. My six-year-old cousin thinks it's about how sad it would be to have scissors for hands.I honestly have no idea what Tim Burton's masterpiece of a movie is ""really"" about. It seems to me that it is very open to interpretation, as there is no real basis to say that any of these ideas are just plain wrong (Can you really say that my cousin's observation that it would be sad to have scissors for hands is way off base?); however none of them really feels right to me.Here is what I have to say about Edward Scissorhands: This movie makes me sob; I mean I just bawl my eyes out every time I watch it. Only God knows why, but for some reason there is nothing sadder than a monstrous looking loner who is misunderstood and taken advantage of. I know it sounds like a specific description, but the idea is just so universally poignant that details and all it has been done numerous times (the most notable being Gaston Leroux's ` The Phantom of the Opera' and of course `Beauty and The Beast').Then there's the whole other story of Johnny Depp's performance. There are a lot of actors who are considered ""good actors"" but we never really think about what their limitations are because we only see them in roles that they can play well (which, of course, would be the reason they're playing them). I am fairly confident that not a lot of actors could have successfully played the part of Edward, so when you consider how successfully Depp did play it that says something. One of the interesting things about the movie is that its title character has what seems like two lines in the whole thing, which made Depp's job of doing a decent job even harder - he never has a weak moment, not once.I do not know what Edward Scissorhands is a metaphor for; however, I do know that this movie successfully makes people feel, whatever it is that they feel when watching it, more than any other movie I know of. It is surprising but telling that a movie that seems so strange could succeed in making so many different people care about the same thing: the fate of a lonely misfit who somehow comes across as far less fictional than it seems that such an obviously imagined creature should. Therefore provoking the question: exactly how much of this ""fantasy movie"" is truly fiction?",5.0,0.8888888888888888,1,1,0.0,neutral,0.994,very positive,2003,7,24

When the FBI finds out they send Sidney Poitier to negotiate for the release. Things go very wrong and the merchants wife and maid are killed. The killer tries to escape to Canada by killing a fisherman headed for a guided tour in the mountains of Vancouver, British Columbia. Poitier enlists the service of Tom Berenger to track the murderer who has now taken his girlfriend hostage. Thrilling and funny this movie is one of the best I have seen. Poitier and Berenger are great as bickering old FBI city smart agent and young headstrong mountain guide. If you like either of these actors you will probably love this movie. Any fans of Poitier will love this movie. Far more exciting than ""In the Heat of the Night"". If you enjoyed the remake of ""The Jackal"" with Sidney you will love it. Those Berneger fans should love it as well. Not as gory as ""Platoon"" or ""Sniper"" it still has some scenes that will have some closing their eyes.Many people I ask have not seen this movie, and I recommend it to them. The movie takes place mainly in Washington state. It has beautiful scenery especially near Pugent Sound. The musical score is well done, and the acting is superb. Sidney Poitier as the aging FBI agent from the city and Tom Berenger as the young rugged outdoorsmen work great together with there constant bickering. Their mutual appreciation for one another slowly grows until they admire one another. Sidney saves Tom from a bear in a way that will have you laughing. Tom saves Sidney from the cold in a way that will have you wondering about what he means about mountain men with a chuckle. Good direction from Roger Spottiswoode. Sidney was 61 at the time this was filmed and he turns in one of his better performances. Kirstie Alley as Tom's girlfriend does a great job as a kidnapped guide. The whole movie keeps you guessing for some time as to the bad guys identity. Nice performances by the guided group. Many recognizable faces that have played bad guys, now all but one are just average guys. This is by far one of my favorite Action/Adventure/Mystery movies that I watch at least twice a year. Even my wife, who doesn't normally like this type movie, finds this one entertaining. Mostly because of the comradery that develops between Poitier and Berenger.

But sadly it was, and this partially completed first season is all we have to enjoy (unless you count the movie that came later on).  But at least what we do have is entertaining.Firefly is the space cowboy series originally thought up by Joss Whedon.  Following the crew of a smuggling ship (or really whatever job they can get) it shows them trying to keep away from the central government.  Which proves tough to do with their line of work and the fugitives that they are transporting as well.  Add in Reavers (crazy space raiders) and not so friendly locals and space is just not a safe place.  But it's a place that feels like home to the spaceship Serenity and her crew.Characters:Nathan Fillion - Malcolm ReynoldsGina Torres - Zoe WashburneAlan Tudyke - Hoban WashburneMorena Baccarin - Inara SerraAdam Baldwin - Jayne CobbJewel Staite - Kaylee FryeSean Maher - Simon TamSummer Glau - River TamRon Glass - Derrial BookMal Reynolds is the captain of the Firefly ship and he's a no-nonsense but fair kind of guy.  He's also got a reasonable sense of humor and he's such a great leading character that you always want to find out what he's going to do next.  His first mate Zoe and her husband (the ship's pilot) are also interesting characters.  Although I think Zoe is a little too serious at times, especially when you compare her to her jovial husband.  One of my favorite characters is Kaylee, the mechanic of the ship, because she is so sweet and down to earth.  She really provides the ""nice"" that the crew of the ship needs.  Jayne, on the other hand, is the muscle and is somewhat dumb, but funny in that dumbness.  The Tam siblings provide some interest, but when it comes to being watchable, I find them the least enjoyable, but when it comes to that series, least enjoyable is still quite good.  Inara is the only one with legitimate work, but it's very interesting and I've seen her job likened to that of a geisha, which I think is pretty accurate.  The last main character, Book, is the preacher, but he has a lot of secrets.The whole space cowboy thing could have been very cheesy, but it's not.  Because of the depth of the characters, settings of the worlds, and the way the plot works, it is wholly original.  I loved that the crew didn't like the main government but had to learn to work within the confines and restrictions of their world(s).  The sets were very realistic and not overly showy.  Even the technology seemed not out-of-this-world and realistic.  And while there was a main plot that ran through the whole series, each episode was a good stand alone and had its own adventures.  Even the bad guys were pretty scary; a government that thinks it's doing good and evil space people that have gone mad.  Gives you a shudder just thinking about it.The special effects, for this being in its first season, were pretty good.  They used a lot of the same sets so they were able to really get it detailed.  The inside of the ship was well done.  I also really liked the music in the series as well.  It followed the country theme more, although there was some ballroom music.  The main theme song was great, lyrics and everything and kind of sets up the whole tone for the series.An excellent show that should have never been canceled.  It's one that I come back to time and time again.  I honestly love everything about it and can't personally find any flaws with it.Review by M.

I just credited the enthusiasts as having very different tastes in Christmas movies.  But, thought I'd  check it out on TCM one year and was truly amazed.  One does need a break from the sentimental and musical ones now and again.As soon as I saw Ralphie's imaginary scene with Mom and Dad and little Randy huddled under the kitchen table, while he, dressed to the cowboy nines, ran off the ruffians, I was hooked.  It's just one funny scene after another, with hilarious sides running through, like Dad and the Bumpus dogs and his bouts with the furnace.

Having absolutely loved the book, I felt sure that the movie adaptation would be just as good.  Read my review of the novel by Kathryn Stockett here.I watched The Help during my 11-month old's naptime, which meant that I watched it with subtitles to keep the volume down.  I think I got more out of the movie that way.  Some of the dialogue was difficult to understand, and watching with subtitles meant that I didn't miss a word.Of course, there were some changes from the book to the movie version, but they did not bother me too much.  I did feel like some of the important scenes were omitted from the movie, especially the part about Minnie and the miscarried baby.The casting was excellent and everyone did such a good job.  I especially loved Viola Davis as Abilene and Octavia Spencer as Minnie.  And Emma Stone is such a good little actress!  I have really enjoyed all of her movies to date.  Allison Janney was a perfect Mrs. Phelan and I thought her scenes were some of the movie's best.The movie adaptation was not as good as the book (which was just outstanding) but it was still a really good movie.

Having grown up with guns and killing for sport, later replaced by ROTC, I understand the biologically determined thrill of the hunt and for those who live in a sheltered urban environment it's surrogate in film/TV and PC/video gaming. Armadillo shows us how technology and killing at a distance has removed the human element from the act of killing thus transforming it into another form of a video game. The recent news video of pissing on Taliban is made more understandable in this film as both the conditioned unemotional training for reactive killing as well as the subsequent dehumanizing changes that are enhanced by combat. Nothing new there; it's as old as being human. But then again if one tallies all the reasons why people kill then combat is just the same, just a different venue.Additionally, we see how the lack of education coupled with conservative religious indoctrination amongst the Afghan peoples leads to narrow simplistic views of life and a distrust of anything/anyone different (not unlike the comparable Christian conservatives). Also shown was how the Taliban are able to successfully manipulate the battlefield rules both in terms of the minds of the local population and in their hit and run tactics thus drawing the foreigners into fighting the people they are trying to protect.",5.0,0.625,6,1,0.0,neutral,-0.9789,very negative,2012,1,14

260559,6301661729,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,5,5,2004-08-17,Satirical Sci-Fi At Its Best,"Franklin Shaffner's 1968 adaptation of Pierre Boulle's (author of 'Bridge On The River Kwai')science-fiction satire still makes audiences ponder on questions of human nature even after almost 40 years with its brilliant script and great special effects.The story follows George Taylor (Charleton Heston) and his 3 crew mates who've been travelling the stars at light speed in suspended animation.  The spaceship is programmed to land back on an Earth that is centuries older but something goes terribly wrong: a system failure leads their ship to land in a desolate sea on an unknown planet.  As the crew members salvage what they can from their sinking ship, their hopes of ever returning home go down to the depths along with their ship.  After some exploration, the disoriented astronauts realize that they aren't alone.  On this new planet, apes are the only intelligent life while human hunter-gatherers live like flocks of mute sheep.  Captured by the apes, Taylor speaks out and sends shockwaves through the ape society's scientific community.  Securing the friendship of two chimp scientists named Cornelius (McDowell) and Zera (Hunter), Taylor seeks to save his life and that of his new silent soul-mate Nova (Harrison) against the fanatical Dr. Zeuss (Evans.)  Will he escape this world gone ape?  What will he find if he does?With a brilliant script written by the legendary Rod Serling of Twilight Zone fame, the audience is plunged into the depths of this political/social satire.  The film explores the concepts of human nature and its fallacies manifested in social institutions such as religion, science, and government.  The film is an attack on preconceptions as to human nature and its place in the universe. Although the film significantly deviates from Boulle's short story, it is far superior to Tim Burton's recent bubble gum adaptation that offers a true satire as opposed to a mindless and generic sci-fi action plot with no theme.  Also, the make-up and costumes in this version are actually more convicing than the glossy and static CGI enhancements in the new film.This is perhaps one of the rare instances where the film is better than the novel that inspired it.  Boulle's novel is short and leaves the plot somewhat lacking as to it characters just as much as the film lacks more detail as to the ape society Taylor finds himself in.  The film somewhat wins over in this comparative deficiency by developing Taylor's character.  Also, the characters in the film being professional astronauts make more sense than Boulle's eccentric scientist and his crew of amateurs.  Focusing the story on Earth instead of another planet and changing the final scene in the film has a greater thematic impact than the one in Boulle's novel.  An interesting fact that both the novel and film seem to ignore is the disparity in physical strength between humans and apes.  If apes would indeed socially evolve to replace humans then humans would be at a serious disadvantage as apes are much stronger in terms of physical strength and so the scenes where Taylor is wrestling free from the clutches of several gorillas is pretty much an impossibility.  The film making the apes less evolved than in the novel also seems to work better.Overall, this is a great film that, despite its changes, conveys most of the theme in the novel and actually does better than the novel in its plot.  A timeless film to be enjoyed by all ages.",5.0,1.0,3,3,0.6369,very positive,0.9982,very positive,2004,8,17

Pat and Bruce also have an 18-year-old daughter named DONNA (played by Lara Flynn Boyle). Carol Anne seems to be adjusting to the city very well, but she is feeling homesick, and misses her family very much. She goes to a school for the gifted. The school's psychiatrist, DR. SEATON (played by Richard Fire) as put Carol Anne under hypnosis, making her relive the memories of her terrifying ordeal with Reverend Kane. Dr. Seaton seems to think that this just in Carol Anne's head, but KANE (played by Nathan Davis) has returned to claim Carol Anne once again.That night, Pat and Bruce head off to an opening part at Pat's new Art Gallery, which is located in the huge Chicago Skyscraper building (both Bruce and Pat work in the building, as well as live in it). Donna is to be babysitting Carol Anne, but knowing that Donna wants to go to her friends' party (who also live in the building), Carol Anne tells Donna to go on ahead to the party. But as Donna leaves, Carol Anne is visited by Kane in a terrifying meeting. At the moment, TANGINA BARRONS (again played by Zelda Rubenstein), who already is on her way to Carol Anne's aid, gives Carol Anne a telepathic message. Carol Anne runs around the garage of the building, where she then steps on a puddle, where the spirits jump up through the puddle grabbing Carol Anne. Donna and her boyfriend, SCOTT (played by Kipley Wentz) are in the security room trying to rig it up, so that they and their friends could have a few hours in the pool, but Donna finds Carol Anne, where she and Scott run to Carol Anne, but the three are pulled into the puddle, and are taken to the other side, where they are between dimensions: they are on the other side of every mirror in the building. Pat and Bruce run up to find Scott shivering and terrified, where Pat and Bruce run up to Carol Anne's bedroom. Carol Anne busts through her door, with Pat trying to pull her out, but Tangina arrives and pushes Pat and Bruce out of the way, informing them that Carol Anne and Donna are not in the room, but on the other side, between dimensions. They find out where Carol Anne and Donna were captured, where Tangina, Bruce, and Pat find Carol Anne in the reflection of the mirror, but the reflection of Carol Anne is Kane in disguise, where he then takes Tangina to other side. Out of the corpse-like body of Tangina (what she turned into after she was taken where Carol Ann and Donna are), Donna comes out of the body, but apparently, this is not Donna, and Scott (who came out of the pool) is not Scott, but some of Kane's disciples in disguise. Pat and Bruce run all over trying to save the girls. They find Tangina, who hands them her necklace (an amulet if you will), where she informs them that Kane is controlling the inside of the building, but not the outside. Bruce and Pat, on a cherry picker, ride up to Carol Anne's window. Bruce hands Pat the necklace, where he enters the bedroom. She sees Carol Anne, where she tells Pat to forget about her, and save Bruce and Donna, but once again, Kane has taken Carol Anne's appearance. Pat enters the room, and has an outing with Kane, until Tangina, who is still on the other side, informs Kane that he does not need Carol Anne to lead him into the light. Tangina takes Kane and leads him into the light. Where Bruce, Donna, and Carol Anne return. Carol Anne's nightmare is over.This was definitely an excellent sequel, and a great way to end the Poltergeist trilogy. Sadly, Heather O'Rourke, the actress who played CAROL ANNE in all three films, sadly passed on in February of 1988, at the tender age of 12. She died just before the film was completed. But the crew decided to finish the film, in honor of Heather O'Rourke. The ending had to be changed, which is why when Tom Skerritt is holding Carol Anne, you never see Carol Anne look up from Tom's shoulder. This is a great film, and we should all keep Heather O'Rourke in our hearts, since she did such a wonderful job playing the character that won our hearts in all three of these films.R.I.P.Heather O'ROURKE(1975-1988)",5.0,0.0,2,1,0.0,neutral,0.9923,very positive,2005,1,19

It's a statement embedded in good acting and pretty cinematography.It features a plotline that is by no means wholly believeable (that never stopped anyone from making an episode of The Mentalist) and it is nothing *like* entirely pleasant (that never stopped anyone from watching an episode of The Mentalist) in which two alienated loners, a divorced middle-aged man and a too-clever teenaged girl, find one another and go on a killing spree that features representations from a rogue's gallery of American incivlity and mental degeneration; one that includes, among others, a Glenn Beck clone, a ""God-hates-gays"" preacher and a large sampling of the superficial, the cruel, the entitled and the merely rude.It is a rant wrapped in a thin layer of movie that displays a very linnear, paint-by-the-numbers plot, the point of which makes the movie almost like something Brecht might have written were he alive today. Goldthwaite's story and how he tells it, like Brecht's, pushes the viewer back far enough to see the point: that we are so bombarded by multimillionaire media personalities vomiting nonsense, dwarf-tossers, infinitely entitled celebrities and the people who have given us the worst of YouTube, that our world is riddled by a media-fueled cancer of noise in which each tumor of diseased culture is replaced by the next one so quickly that horrible events driven by horrible people have become our norm and we cease to notice the presence of the disease, that things were ever otherwise,  or to imagine that anything else is possible.""God Bless America"" is a black comedy that at times is not entirely funny, but that is nevertheless worth watching for its point.If it *was* entirely funny, it would be part of the problem.",5.0,0.7777777777777778,1,1,0.3612,positive,-0.9871,very negative,2012,5,29

1110623,B000WMFZII,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,0,0,2011-10-14,GREAT FOR A SYFY FLICK,"MANEATERThe Maneater series is a pretty crazy one as it pits natures beats [real and not so much] against man. Usually they kill off man easily until the end where the lead takes them on and some how comes out on top. This movie starring Gary Busey was based on the novel ""Shikar"" by Jack Warner, and the movie also has a cool cover. I don't know why I needed to say that but I like the cover for this one.An escaped Bengal tiger terrorizes a small town by hunting and killing of the townsfolk and the authorities that are after him. Turns out that some kid has a weird connection to the tiger as it comes by his house at night and watches him from the window, never attacks but just watches. The Sheriff of the town played by Busey is on the hunt and calls in the National Guard to help out. But as the body count rises and pieces are found every where it seems only a pro tiger hunter can make things right.I have to say this is actually one of the better films in the series with Busey's eccentric facial expressions and a pretty good story. It is still your usual SyFy low budget movie but it is just done well in my opinion. Ty Wood is really good as the kid obsessed with the tiger, you may remember him from ""A Haunting in Connecticut"". Ian D. Clark as well is good here as the big game hunter looking to make up for a mistake in the past. There is also a super funny moment in which Busey answers a reporters question, you will know it when you see it.The writer here and the director did a pretty good job here as the film always is entertaining.

First of all, this is an extremely good Zatoichi episode, with a much different ending than many of the others. In the film, Zatoichi enters an inn to stay the night, but  must share it with a sick woman and her young son. During the night the sick woman dies. However, before she dies she begs Zatoichi to take the boy to his father Shokichi [Takao Ito]. Along the way Zatoichi becomes very attached to the young boy: but as his way of life is not safe for this young boy he knows that he must part ways with him. Therefore, it is importatnt that he find the father. The young boys only link in the world now that the mother is dead.Along the way, Zatoichi comes across a mysterious and unknown  samurai [Jushiro Konoe]. This samurai shadows Zatoichi along the way. Who is he? What does he want? Well, apparently the boys father is in the pornography business. Tame by any means, but forbidden by law under penalty of death. However, Shokichi--a talented artist, is not doing this of his own bidding, he is being forced to do this artwork on pottery by an evil warlord. And as for the mystery samurai? Well, he is a government official. And more importantly he has the official sanction of the state to enforce the law, which means carrying out the death sentence.Therefore Zatoichi must comply with the laws of the land. He must turn over Shokichi. Or will he? Moreover, this mystery samurai is no slouch with the sword. He is an expert swordsman as good--if not better than Zatoichi. Plus the samurai is honorable and carries himself with dignity. The mystery samurai has his orders and must carry them out--under no exception. But Zatoichi, being who he is by nature, defender of the weak and oppressed, will he allow the samurai to do this? Knowing that Shokichi is being forced against his will to make this art, will Ichi allow this execution to proceed? The conclusion of the episode is most unusual and I do not wish to spoil it by telling you, however, this episode is definetly different than his other ""wipe up the town"" endings. There is an unusual ending with this samurai. A VERY DIFFERENT kind of ending. Highly recommened.",5.0,1.0,2,1,-0.5473,negative,-0.9899,very negative,2006,9,1

The arrogance, cynicism and touch of self-aggrandizement are just about perfect.  To say nothing of the physicality of Frewer's take on Holmes.  And of course that marvelolous voice with it's barely concealed snobbishly modulated inflection.The Sherlock Holmes Collection (""The Hound of the Baskervilles,"" ""The Sign of the Four,"" ""The Case of the Whitechapel Vampire"" and ""The Royal Scandal"") are not big budget productions, but they are effective and entertaining and the screenplay interpretations of these familiar public domain stories are fresh.

793888,B00015YVI6,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,1,1,2013-01-29,Hope Springs Eternal as does Colin Firth the Oscar Man!,"HOPE SPRINGS (Writ./Dir. Mark Herman, 2003, 95 minutes). I just got to see this amazing comedy and first of all, it escapes me why in 2012 there was a Tommy Lee Jones movie of the exact same title (Hope Springsso you won't confuse the two), but it is not a remake or remotely related to this Colin Firth-stravaganza comedy.On the other hand, perhaps it is a remake ... I'm not sure. See what this rip-off titling does to a man?!Really, I am getting quite tired of this title-copying which seems deliberate. But why on earth do it in the first place? There aren't enough words in English to make up good, new titles? Whenever the two films show on cable, as with all such titles, the films get mixed up!Here, Colin Firth plays Colin, a spectacular fine artist who is fed up with his life in England and his obnoxious ex-fianc&eacute;e (Minnie Driver). He flees to a town called Hope - in VERMONT, people, not Maine - and sets up shop, falls in love and proves Americans can be far crazier than the British ever were. From the goofy hotel proprietress where Colin stays (a great, understated Mary Steenburgen) to the crazed mayor (a brilliant-as-usual Oliver Platt), Colin finds America has what England has and then some.For Colin there's sweet and wonderful love in the heavenly form of Heather Graham. First, however, he'll have to deal with Minnie Driver's obsessive stalking. Can you imagine being stalked by her? She still has the looks and body to melt a refrigerator, British or American. This is a popcorn comedy, much like the ones Colin Firth decided to concentrate on doing after he made himself in the immortal PRIDE & PREJUDICE.For all its concentration on Colin Firth, the film is a pleasure and I was wowed by the fact that it is technically a British film, though I say it is really an American film with two English people in it. Fall-down funny moments and dry British wit make excellent bedfellows, and we have far too few gems like this to be able to discuss the genre as yet. That is a pity. This film has a few little homages in it: THE GRADUATE is the most recognizable and there are subtle references to other films.I must say, Colin Firth is busy as hell and I LOVE it as I love him. Seeing him is an automatic deal-maker for me, and I will watch anything he's in - anything. And he has made a couple of stinkers. Yet this film made me think of all the films of his I really admire and have reviewed here:BRIDGET JONES' DIARY and BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON, WHAT A GIRL WANTS, GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING, LOVE ACTUALLY, THE LAST LEGION, WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE YOUR FATHER?, MAMMA MIA!, DORIAN GRAY, A SINGLE MAN, THE KING'S SPEECH, MAIN STREET, and most lately though I haven't seen them is THE DEVIL'S KNOT (based on the true story of the ""West Memphis Three"") and BRIDGET JONES' BABY.Well, if all that does not convince you to get this jewel of a sleeper comedy, then just take my word for it: it is funny, warm and fabulous.

Imagine my surprise when I put this thing in on my MacBook and beheld an incredibly well-shot view of the early-80s Stones. Knowing what I now know, this turns out to be the capstone on their legendary live performing career -- everything after this was pure tribute (and I write that based on having run across ""Steel Wheelchairs"" on PBS one night a few months back -- really pro forma, that one and everything since, it's Stones spelled out for the masses, for anyone not smart enough to figure it out for themselves, and thus not really art at all). That's part of what makes this movie so good, it has none of the self-consciousness and micro-attention to spelled-out detail of their later tours and films (see: ""Shine a Light""). The camera in this film is unblinking, which means the editor just let the scenes roll along and speak for themselves -- and they are nice, long scenes, from some really outstanding angles that get us close without being too close, and sometimes just far enough away to see what they were up to. No jumbo-trons, very few big effects, really -- just a great rock band doing their thing. I really got a sense from looking at this what the Stones were like in concert on that tour, which seems to have been the closest in their late-modern phase ('75-on) to being great in concert while also having some decent product in the record stores and on the radio.

384819,6303686745,A3TO3AY1UFM83U,1,2,2011-09-26,"The Best, the Brightest, and the Bomb","Just about anyone who came of age during the Cold War will find Fail Safe chilling and still relevant.  Deterrence was based on the very real prospect of mutually assured destruction.  In spite of right-wing think tank products such as the late Herman Kahn's On Thermonuclear War, it was clear to anyone who thought about it with a head unclogged by ideological absurdities and half-baked policy wonk speculations that an exchange of ballistic missile-borne nuclear warheads between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. would leave the world uninhabitable.  And that was before anyone had foreseen the phenomenon we now know as nuclear winter.In spite of that, there were vainglorious, Kissingeresque hawks on both sides.  Walter Matthau does a superb job, almost salivating at the prospect of finding out if tough and violent convicts protected by their prison walls, or organizationally savvy file clerks, insulated by shelves and cabinets loaded with thick reams of paper, would prevail in a war among the likely survivors.  Yes, as we learned in Viet Nam and Iraq, ivory tower intellectuals, chicken hawks to a man, can be very dangerous, destroying the lives of thousands of patriotic soldiers and ordinary civilians.  In Fail Safe it's the career soldiers and airmen, people who have actually experienced war, who prevail, at least long enough to provide painful but essential perspective.Henry Fonda, not one of my favorite people, but perfect for the role of the U.S. President during an unprecedented international crisis, also understands what's at stake.  He, and eventually the Soviet leadership, understand that complex systems will eventually malfunction, and may bring us to the brink of mutual annihilation.  They also know that even accidents acknowledged as eventually inevitable may exact a terrible toll.  A good faith gesture that costs millions of lives to restore a still-precarious balance.  A horrible trade-off, the price paid to save the world, at least for now.The flip side of Fail Safe is made all too real by Richard Widmark's portrayal of the Captain of a state-of-the-art enemy submarine chaser in The Bedford Incident.  Just as machines inevitably malfunction, men pushed too hard for too long become exhausted, error prone, and desperate.  When the people in charge are so Hell-bent on wreaking havoc on an audacious and resourceful enemy, the eventual results are easy to foresee.  I've never known if the torpedoes fired, in one last act of defiant fatalism by the doomed nuclear submarine were nuclear tipped.  That only makes The Bedford Incident a more sobering complement to Fail Safe.During the Cold War, the enemies were well-defined and mutually accessible, subject to a reign of destruction that neither side wanted and both sought to prevent.  Today, with nuclear proliferation occurring in both nationalistically celebratory and surreptitious ways, there are more ideologues willing, perhaps even eager, to destroy the world.  Actually, it seems odd that it hasn't happened yet.Fail Safe is still pertinent, but it's also a film for another era.  It's pertinent because nuclear weapons are at least as destructive as in the 1960's, and the systems that control them are even more complex.  It's a film for another time, however, because current international circumstances are laced with heavier and more varied doses of fanaticism, and there are more enemies who are harder to find.  Makes the Cold War sound like a good thing, a precarious set of circumstances, to be sure, but one with built-in stabilizers, even if they were imperfect.",5.0,0.5,1,1,0.7184,very positive,-0.9979,very negative,2011,9,26

That's pretty much what Michael Winterbottom an co do with 24 Hour Party people as they depict the history of Factory Records and their founder Tony Wilson.  It's told with narration by Tony Wilson, played here by Steve Coogan.  A movie like this could easily turn into boring drama if told in typical biographical fashion, but Winterbottom has a lot of fun with the material, playing with visuals, frequently breaking the fourth wall (""It'll probably appear on the DVD), and making fun of its own contrivance of history (""I don't remember this happening"").  With all the liberties it took, there's alot in here that is correct, such as the abnormal formation of Factory Records, the bankrupting because of lack of sound record contracts and a club overun by drugs, and the depictions of a lot of the players in the film.  Andy Serksis performance of the quirky producing genius Martin Hannett is priceless.  Of course, one of the major highlights is the Madchester music scene, appearing throughout the film.The bonus here is the DVD, which is equally compelling.  Tony Wilson's commentary is priceless and is one of the best DVD commentaries out there.  He frequently criticizes the liberties the filmakers took and then pointing at some of the genius of the film.  He comes off simultaneously as both intellectual and smug.  He criticizes Coogan's portrayal of him, but as you listen to Wilson, you realize Coogan was pretty head on.  There are also a substantial amount of deleted scenes and a couple making of documentaries.24 Hour Party People is an amazing film, regardless if you know the music or not.  Performances are top notch and the DVD is full of extras for the enthusiast.  I frequently have this DVD playing as its so funny and quoteable.

Great action and of course the famous score by Elmer Bernstein.The sub-plots of the making of the movie include these big names, particlarly McQueen and Brynner constantly trying to one up wach other with background histrionics.The DVD includes a new documentary done in 2001 which includes new interviews with surviving cast members but also old footage of Brynner.

This particular night he performs live on Broadway (the culmination of a 20+ city national tour, and marking the conclusion of his triumphant, and much-heralded return to the ""stage"" in over 16 years). And what is the verdict??? BRILLIANCE!! The same brand of raunchy, charismatic, no holds-barred, yet very intelligent humor Williams has been known for.ONE THING NEEDS TO BE POINTED OUT: Williams' energy is unparalleled in his stand-up work and is NOTHING like his theatrical roles (from Flubber to Insomnia), which only seem to stifle the madman lurking beneath. With uncensored, and essentially unscripted stand-up, Robin is able to reveal his TRUE SELF. However, this is not some mindless rant... Williams seems to emerge from a shell he's been keeping himself in... commentating on social and political issues of the day (from foreign relations, biological warfare, sex, and even sports).Where this ""movie"" truly earns 5 STARS is in Williams's performance itself. Sadly, comics today go through ""ho-hum"" HBO specials like candy (I will not name names), giving audiences and viewers 60-65 minutes. Williams goes non-stop for 2 hours!! And as a result becomes so drenched in sweat by the end, you begin to wonder how he's still standing!Material-wise, I feel there is no one better, with Williams delivery of quips, jokes, and punchlines only rivaled by George Carlin, and the shows of Eddie Murphy from the early to mid 1980s.The DVD package, as many other DVDs seem to nowadays, comes with more than anyone could have expected, with behind-the-scenes broadcasts, and a full interview with the maestro himself. The picture and sound quality are superb and nothing seems to have been lost in the transfer.Bottomline: though perhaps crude at some points, I think that ANYONE with at least a partially open mind and a love for laughs will enjoy this movie. Take it from my mother (a 52 year-old Frenchwoman not necessarily in tune with ""hip society"") sitting crying from laughter, ""He is the best!""",5.0,0.9605263157894736,1,2,0.3612,positive,0.9611,very positive,2002,11,25

Not content to just be a funny movie, or a movie about the thrill of new love, it combines both and mixes in a heaping helping of strangeness and random meaningless events to pull together a lovely picture of life as it really can be. It's harnessing all the meaningless little things of daily life into the swirling coherence of your life.In the big picture, I guess Amelie could be considered a romantic comedy, but it is so much more. It's a surreal slice of a France that alternately does and does not exist. It's the deep meaning of it all, as well as the utter meaninglessness of day-to-day life.Visually, it is a stunning achievement. If you pay attention to adults, or watch an hour of HGTV you'll soon realize that for some reason when most people grow up, their favorite colors somehow become tan and off-white. Amelie's world is one of color and joy, even in sadness. It's a world of hyper-natural color... the type of world within which every child would love to live.Audrey Tautou brought to life one of the singlemost memorable characters in movie history with her role as Amelie. The writing here is great, unique, and funny, but there is so much hilarious stuff Audrey can do just with a look that this still could have been an entertaining movie even if the writing had been much less inventive and funny. I recently picked up Dirty Pretty Things almost solely because Audrey is one its main characters. After Amelie, I just had to see her in more movies.If director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, is ever able to top Amelie, that movie will certainly be another of the best films ever made.Experience Amelie for yourself.

422161,6304438176,AWUUMER0F3WF4,1,1,2014-02-09,"""Oh, They're Fine ... Except Dad's Dying"" - Bessie","Jerry Zaks directs ""Marvin's Room"" from the screenplay adapted from Scott McPherson's own play which is full of nuanced and layered character portrayals.  Mainly the primary study is the caring relationship between two sisters.  Bessie (Diane Keaton), a woman who gave up twenty years of her life to care for her elderly father, who is now sick and dying, along with their aunt who also lives there. Aunt Ruth has made herself comfortable in her own world of the soap operas and a reality that she makes believable every day.  Then there is the guarded and wayward, verbally combative sister, Lee (Meryl Streep).  She left and stayed away for two decades to find a life away from home, while the compliant Bessie remained behind to serve her family.  Lee has passed her cosmetology license, is looking towards a life of helping herself as far away as possible, and trying to help her two sons to a better life that is not working for her.Bessie has been visiting the doctor regularly concerning a possible vitamin deficiency that she may have. She is seeing a new Dr. who is now filling in for her regular Dr. and is the rather sweet and somewhat bumbling Robert De Niro.  He is concerned with her workload at home caring for everyone.  The doctor finally hires his brother Bob (Dan Hadeya), who adds a comedic flare along with De Niro.  Bessie has to let the doctor know that there is cancer in her history and gets a diagnosis of Leukemia herself, she now needs a match for a bone marrow transplant.  Lee and her sons are being summoned to aid Bessie with her dilemma.  Bessie undergoes the painful tests of a bone marrow extraction finding the worst to be true, thus starting the strained repertoire of finding a match with her sister Lee first.  Lee has two children, one being a teenaged Hank (Leonardo  DeCaprio), who cannot avoid getting into trouble.  He has just burned their family home down and is confined to a mental illness ward.  The younger brother's (Charlie) behavior is nonvolatile, inquisitive, and is the family bookworm.  Hank's behavior comes out further into the movie along with the reasons why he is so very angry.No one has met anyone yet, it has been so extremely long since the two sisters last spoke and now must figure out if a familial love will hold this taut and fractured family together.  The sisters are polar opposites, and before one should judge the personalities, friction is the basis of what is reality in most families.  At the core of their problems are deep-seated reasons why the two could never be close before now.Hume Cronyn is perfect as a bedridden and very ill father who is the catalyst for Bessie and Lee to finally be honest with one another.  One particular moment in this heart-tugging film is when Bessie gently explains to Lee that she had an all-encompassing love before too; one she never spoke of to anyone.  She only kept it in her heart.  It is after this time Lee realizes that she is dealing with a part of her own self, if only a small part, it is still something that could have happened to a woman causing her heart to never allow it to open up again.  Finally, a breaking point for Lee and Bessie, and a reason to want to know the incidences about her son Hank.  Lee's son gets along so well with his newly found Aunt Bessie to Lee's chagrin.  She doesn't have to push like a mother would, or discipline, but just love him for who he is.  That she does without reservation.So much reflection about the sisters being young and loving comes through in Marvin's room.  Bessie lies on the bed with her father flashing a mirror against the wall, gazing at its dancing reflection making him laugh with glee.  It is in all of these simple little things where this movie triumphs.  The passing on of the tools to Hank, the driving along the shoreline without abandon and Lee lovingly does Bessie's hair and makeup allowing her a new look and a liberating feeling. Everything good, kind, simple, and lovely, make Marvin's Room the place to find that this is where a family's heart needs to be.",5.0,1.0,1,1,0.2023,positive,0.9963,very positive,2014,2,9

1226921,B001PCNZEU,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,2,2,2011-07-29,Fantastic Russian Historical Actioner,"This film is set at the beginning of the 17th century when Russia had a severe crisis over who was to inherit the throne after the Tsar died. There are many contenders but none too genuine. This was called the time of `chaos' as the people are leaderless, and the Poles had invaded Russia. Their Hetman (Michel Zebrowski) has captured the Tsarina Kseniya Godunova. He has fallen in infatuation with her and sees marriage to her as a way to legitimise his false claim to the throne.  Throw into the mix a lowly serf Andrei played by Pyotr Kislov, he really does love the Tsarina and through guile and cunning sets about saving her and in the long run, Russia too.The opening sequences start in 1605 and we get a pocket `history' lesson to take us up to date. This is not a true history lesson though and quite happily mixes up faith, mysticism and myth with all the action. We have a holy man who won't come down from his tree until the chaos has ended, lots of iconography (very Russ indeed) and a recurring theme of Unicorns.  Whilst we are thrown into the current plight of the characters, the missing detail is told in vivid flashback, so by about half way through you get to understand the real histories of those involved and the attraction Andrei has for the Tsarina.This has been criticised for being anti -Polish, well of course it is, this is a Russian film and the Poles are the enemy. They do get the best costumes though, they are all armoured up and wear wings to give them the look of avenging angels. That is one of the many strengths of this film, the costumes are stunning. Add to that the overall excellent cinematography and attention to detail and this makes for a real visual feast.There is buckets of action too and it is done really well, the CGI that had to be used in places is so good that you really don't notice and as good special effects should do, it actually adds to the emotional upsurge that was intended.  Look out for the siege sequences, they are brilliant. My only complaint is around the subtitles, not everything is translated especially the Italian parts; and on occasion the Russian translation is over the English translation, making it virtually impossible to read.That aside, this is a rollercoaster of a film, with action, intrigue, romance and a ruddy great story with excellent performances all round. Vladimir Khotinenko has done a masterful job in the direction of this film, and at 143 minutes has done superbly to keep the momentum up throughout. If you like action films based on historical events, then you will not be disappointed. If you want a history lesson this is not for you, but I thought it was just excellent and intend to watch again very soon.",5.0,1.0,1,1,0.5574,positive,0.9973,very positive,2011,7,29

562274,B00004ZEU2,AYVQMWDUSGL2C,2,3,2013-05-26,Making The '60s What They Are Today: The Beatles get the Spinal Tap treatment,"it makes sense. we keep hearing Monty Python described as The Beatles of British comedy, and also that there was a certain camaraderie between the two. it's a bummer that it had to be the work of a solo Python with a cameo appearance by one other (Michael Palin) rather the collective Python, but on the whole it still seems only fitting.possibly the most obvious thing to need to be said is that it is ""Rutt-les,"" not ""Root-les."" i always assumed it was the latter and still think that's the funnier option, but it turns out there's a logic to it. the concept began in Eric Idle's series RUTLAND WEEKEND TELEVISION. one of the running gags is that the series originated in Rutland, the very smallest, least influential province of the entire U.K. just about everything that happens in Rutland is so trademarked, usually with that ""Rut"" prefix, in the fruitless hope that one of these projects becomes famous and finally puts Rutland on the map.the familiar story tells how the ""Prefab Four"" - Dirk, Nasty, Stig, & Barry - go from Liverpool to Hamburg to The Ed Sullivan Show and just about every point in between. geographically speaking, they go the same route as a certain John, Paul, George, & Ringo went in a parallel universe.the most to be appreciated thing is that the comedy aims for the Beatles phenomenon, and even their personalities, but has proper respect for their music. the film understands that the achievement of The Beatles is such that they are sacred. after all, The Beatles did pretty much invent music!! (i don't usually believe in sacred cows, but every rule has an exception.)so much so, in fact, that the music is actually pretty good. under the supervision of Python crony Neil Innes, The Rutles come off as a competent Beatles-inspired act, a' la Gerry & The Pacemakers or The Dave Clark Five. what's more, when it gets it's most Beatles-esque, it's so faithful it almost sounds like the real deal. take ""Love Life,"" the song Innes fashioned from ""All You Need Is Love."" it's refrain goes ""love is the meaning of life, life is the meaning of love""...and you actually find yourself wondering how John Lennon missed that mantra.what's parodied is the hysteria surrounding Beatlemania and it's most ludicrous aftermaths. take Lennon's infamous ""more popular than Jesus"" debacle. here, Nasty gets in trouble for saying the band is ""bigger than God."" it turns out he actually said bigger than Rod, meaning a not yet famous Rod Stewart.(from Eric Idle's commentary we get a not often told story of divine justice: it turns out the interview in question was months old at the time the controversy exploded. a radio station form the Deep South found the article and threw a hissy-fit solely to get themselves on the map. how the Almighty felt about The Beatles became clear not long after when a lightning bolt put the station out of business.)there are numerous celebrity cameos, including one George Harrison as one of numerous interviewers. possibly because the film is co-produced by Lorne Michaels, several Saturday Night Live alumni - Dan Aykroyd, Gilda Radner, John Belushi, Al Franken - turn up. Murray ""The K,"" a disc jockey from the midwest who rode the crest of Beatlemania to the point that he dared to declare himself the 5th Beatle, is played by a certain Ghostbuster as ""Bill Murray The K.""and there are some pretty good bits of Pythonism that don't necessarily relate to The Beatles. one running gag has Idle's interviewer character reporting as he walks down the street, and having to run when the truck carrying the camera speeds up for no apparent reason. the same interviewer states that, in order to explore the blues roots of rock, he's on his way to the banks of the Mississippi...and we find him in the city next to the sort of bank that involves money.but still, it's the Beatles-related jibes we're here for. like when the Rutles' final tour culminates at ""Che Stadium, named for the reknown Cuban Gueriila leader...Che Stadium.""i'm tempted to ask you to please give THE RUTLES a shot even if you're not a Beatles fan. but come to think of it, there's only one legitimate excuse for not being a Beatles fan, and that's being deaf.",5.0,0.6666666666666666,2,2,0.0,neutral,0.9963,very positive,2013,5,26

654746,B00005JPO1,A223UJ9MON2Y8N,2,6,2008-08-13,The Stars are for Indy....not the film,"To start off, this film is enjoyable to the die-hard Indy fan - someone like me who grew up watching the daredevil archaeologist in the theaters some 27 years ago.  To be honest, I was so excited to see Indiana Jones in the theaters again after all these years, that I was willing to forgive this film its short comings.  I saw it three times, and each time I found something new I liked, and something new I didn't like.First, while I was hesitant (Warning! Spoilers ahead!) about the concept of Indy having a son, I ended up really liking Shia LeBeouf's portrayal of Mutt Williams.  He has flawless timing and a razor sharp wit that fit perfectly into the film and made him, in my opinion, a likable addition to the franchise.  Karen Allen was great in her reprisal of Marion.  This time she returns with more wisdom and less shock to the chaos around her.  I also like the fact that the story ""came full circle"" for the Jones-Ravenwood love affair.Now for the downside.... The film is choppy.  You are being given a lot of information in random quick scenes that never really allow you to get comfortable in any of them.  You don't have any scenes like you do with Indy and Marcus in Raiders just sitting in Indy's house speaking in reverent tones about great artifacts - although, you do get to see Indy's house, but its quick and you don't feel like you've been offered a seat this time.  Its more just a plot device so he can tell you that his father and Marcus are now both deceased.  You also don't have those little moments where the film is still long enough to hear John William's score and to get that ""epic"" feeling.The computer effects took away from the film.  I can support the use of CGI when it is used to fill in the gaps in a film, like Lord of the Rings.  They couldn't cast a cave troll now could they?  But in the case with Indiana Jones, I would have preferred if they could have stuck with their older film making techniques.  After all, Indiana Jones is happening in a bygone era, and the old serial style techniques and actual sets added to the feel of the old films.  They are sadly missed here.  I wouldn't have minded so much, but the CGI isn't even good.  In the new trend of ILM, their effects are ""too video game"" looking.  It detracts from the flow of the film.There is also the problem of the comedy...In the last three films, Indy was actually a fairly serious person.  However, when placed in the horrible situations he often found himself in, a natural humor emanated that captured audience's hearts.  You found yourself thinking ""boy, I wonder if I could smirk like that in that situation.""  In this film though, its like the characters were trying to be intentionally funny.  What happened were a lot of re-used phrases from the old films, and facial expressions that were just corny.  Don't do that.  Don't reuse old lines that were once original.  When you say them again, you are just setting up for a bad poorly thought out sequel.The alien concept, in my opinion, did not detract from the film.  I like sci-fi, and I already had a basic notion about the stories surrounded the crystal skulls.  I don't feel that the film did a very good job explaining it though.  Like I said, it was rough and choppy in its editing.  You feel like you are being taken from one scene to the next as quickly as possible.  I loved Spielberg's aliens in Close Encounters, but I was rather disappointed with unveiling of the alien in this film.  I would have been far more impressed if the alien's from Close Encounters had re-appeared here!All in all, you have to take this movie for what it is.  If you are an Indy fan, then the nostalgia wrapped around the film will be more than enough to get you through the film, and you can even enjoy it.  It just will not be the same enjoyment, wonder, and awe that you had with the first three.  I will add this film to my collection for that very reason.  The film had some major problems, but it was fun to sit in the theater again, and hear that theme song start playing while eating popcorn.  That was always the purpose of these films, after all - to entertain.  And, it is Indiana Jones, so all things said, I was happy to be there with him looking for those skulls, and in the end that was what it was all about.  Don't overestimate the quality, but don't underestimate the legend.",5.0,0.3333333333333333,1,9,0.0,neutral,0.9966,very positive,2008,8,13

His sense of aesthetic balance and composition are totally beyond reproach.One of the reasons I love the work of Antonioni (showcased perfectly in this film), is that I am able to grasp the central ideas without the need to be overly analytical. La Notte, at it's surface, is about the break-down of a marriage. Digging deeper, it is about the hopelessness  of life and our struggles to make meaning of the world around us.Whenever our protagonists are on-screen, Antonioni's camera is either looking down on them, or framing them as an aside to the world they are in (many shots seemingly focus more on the city around the characters).I highly recommend the work of this incredible talent to anyone who enjoys cinema at its purest.",5.0,0.0,1,2,0.6239,very positive,0.957,very positive,2007,3,6

947590,B000BPL2F6,A2R6RA8FRBS608,1,1,2009-03-30,deeply moving and memorable,"Yesterday is a heartrending portrait of a very brave South African woman who, after falling ill, learns that she is HIV positive--and that her prognosis is poor to say the least. While this is not a film for the faint at heart, it's a rare look at how AIDS affects people in rural African communities. The acting is very convincing; the casting could not have been done any better. The cinematography is especially memorable as this film was shot in Africa; the scenic landscapes and that long opening shot of the African desert stand out and even drive home the desolation the principle characters feel during the movie. The choreography works best in crowd scenes but the scenes at the village water well are also very well choreographed. The plot held my attention every step of the way and at the end I was very deeply moved.When the film begins we quickly meet a young South African woman named Yesterday (Leleti Khumalo) and her daughter Beauty (Lihle Mvelase) as they make the long walk to a medical clinic far from their village. Unfortunately, when they arrive they are turned away--they have come too late for the clinic's only doctor to be able to see them; and this happens again the following week. However, Yesterday has a bit of good luck; she befriends a newcomer to the village who is a warmhearted schoolteacher (Harriet Lenabe). The teacher sees that Yesterday has difficulty just getting to the other village in time to make the doctor so she pays the five rand for Yesterday to take a taxi to the clinic. Once at the clinic, Yesterday becomes alarmed when the doctor (Camilla Walker) wants to draw blood for testing. Things only worsen; when Yesterday returns the following week for her blood test results she learns that she is HIV positive and that she will surely die because there just isn't enough medicine for the clinic to save lives.And it gets even bleaker, although Yesterday bravely puts on a smile for the sake of keeping her daughter Beauty in good spirits. Yesterday must now tell her husband John (Kenneth Khambula), who works in a mine in Johannesburg, that she is HIV positive and that he must get tested for the virus, too. When Yesterday tells John, he becomes enraged at the very thought of all this and he viciously beats up Yesterday while the supervisor simply sits there and does nothing to stop it.Of course, from here the plot can go anywhere. How long with Yesterday live? She wants to survive at least until her child Beauty starts school. Will her husband John also be HIV positive? Will Beauty need to get tested as well? What happens if the villagers ostracize the family? Who will look after Beauty when Yesterday has passed on? Watch and find out.Yesterday is one of those rare movies that you watch knowing that you're seeing a very high quality film from start to finish. These actors gave everything they had to make their performances shine; and it shows. This is a remarkably poignant drama that should stir emotions in anyone who has a heart. In addition, I highly recommend this film for people interested in human rights and the fight against AIDS.",5.0,1.0,9,1,0.0,neutral,0.997,very positive,2009,3,30

1001843,B000GCFO08,A1BAQVTLZB9CI3,11,12,2006-04-25,A thought provoking Modern Horror,"The nations ""so-called"" top critics have been bellyaching for years about the current crop of horror moves.  They have whined and complained about those films repetitiveness: [...] teenagers/young adults being tortured and killed by a sadistic psycho, the lack of intelligence in those films, and those movies focusing on entertaining an audience with nudity, bloodshed, or a combination of the two.  So finally a horror movie is released that doesn't adhere to this standard and yet again they're still bellyaching.  Perhaps because some people can't be satisfied or maybe their negative reviews of this film stem from their inability to use their brains when watching a horror movie so they go out and wrongfully label this film as plotless and confusing.Since those ""so-called"" top critics failed to grasp the plot and were confused, I'll enlighten them a bit.  I won't give away any major spoilers since that would ruin the movie for people who have yet to see it, but I will put out some useful information on some stuff that to me is elementary, but the ""so called"" top critics seemed to not have not been able to understand (honestly, what are they being paid for).  The basic plot of this movie is that Sharon DaSilva is in the mysterious town of Silent Hill looking for her missing adopted daughter named Sharon DaSilva.  In the process of looking for her she is lead from place to place by an entity that is intent on using her to seek revenge.  What's so confusing about that?Other important aspects of the film that went over the heads of those critics was having a basic understanding of the fact that there are 3 worlds that exist in Silent Hill.  Those 3 worlds are reality, the other world, and the nightmare world.  Reality in the film is the world where the husband and Officer Gucci are as they try to locate Rose, Sharon, and Cybil.  In this world the town is abandoned because of the ash, smoke and forever burning mines that requires them to have to wear protective facemasks.The other world in the film is a foggy place where ash falls like snow.  It is in this world that Rose, Cybil and Sharon are first transported to.  It is a vastly empty place that is completely closed off from the outside world by cliffs.  The religious zealots-miners who like Rose, Cybil, and Sharon have been pulled here inhabit it.  It also contains strange, mal-formed creatures.Then there`s the third and final world.  This is a nightmare world.  But who's nightmare world is it? My recommendation is watch the movie and find out.  This world is a dark, and burned placed filled with the hideous creatures.  In this world a child molester appears as an S& M styled beast, there's a monster wielding a giant blade with a pyramid shaped head, there are also lots of bugs (scary stuff to a child), and burned childlike creatures who scream and cry out as they harass Rose in a well-done scene.The other world's transformation to this nightmare world is indicated by the sound of sirens.  Here's a hint figuring out why sirens are heard will help you movie critics figure out who's nightmare it is.  It will also help you analysis an important aspect of the film's storyline.So would I recommend this movie?  You bet.  It's one of the best video game adaptations out there.  I should know because I've seen more than my fair share of terrible movie adapations based on popular video games, the Resident Evil movies and Super Mario Brothers are some of the bad ones that immediately come to mind.  I can only wonder what the studios were thinking when they released those extremely awful films.This movie is also a great stand alone horror film.  The visuals are beautiful and the story complex and tragic.  So forget the critics and their inability to think when watching a horror movie and enjoy this great film.

Tom Courtenay is Billy, a perpetual liar; he's trapped in his own drab, stifling northern England surroundings, and his only escape is a fantasy world he's concocted. Where Mitty would just innocently imagine another time and place for himself, Billy involves everyone around him in his chronic lying. Sometimes the lies are connected with the fantasies (going to London to write TV scripts, for example), but usually they are just outright lies not connected to anything: he's engaged to two women at the same time, he lies to his boss and family about what he's up to, are just two examples. Mitty was henpecked by his wife; Billy by his whole world.Courtenay is brilliant, and the intercutting of his fantasies with the real world is also excellently done. The message is universal: we all feel trapped at times and wish we could escape; we either do escape or somehow find a rational way to cope. For Billy, there's no way to do either. He almost escapes at the end with Julie Christie, who has a small role as a creature who CAN escape at will, but he chickens out. The acting, the script, even the photography, are all superb.

Unlike Nietzsche's idea that 'Whatever does not kill you, makes you stronger', Bond is weaker from what didn't kill him.This is a damaged, unshaven Bond who is struggling to keep up his indestructible and arrogant image. It's suggested to Bond, ""Why not stay dead?""The rest of the movie concerns Bond's 'hobby'; ""Resurrection,"" as he puts it. What follows is a masterpiece of psychological rebirth, mixed with suspenseful action.

669734,B00005NQGQ,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,8,8,2008-08-03,A Forgotten Gem,"This moving film from director Robert Benton brings to life a time and place as few films have ever done. Benton based this on his memories growing up and everything is authentic to the smallest detail. He shows the good and the bad of this area and era in small town Texas. Sally Field deservedly won the Oscar for her natural and poignant performance and Danny Glover is just as memorable.Waxahachie, Texas, in 1935 when jobs are scarce and justice often left in the hands of men hiding behind sheets is the setting for this tender look at times trying to change before people are ready to. Field is extraordinary as Edna Spaulding, finding she and her two children suddenly alone when her sheriff husband is killed by accident. She has no idea how to support her family and the bank wants her to sale her home and the land around it to pay off her mortgage. She is scared but determined to find a way to stay.Along comes Moses (Danny Glover) to suggest she use the small amount of land to plant cotton. It will give her enough to save her home and feed her children. But Moses is a black man in a time when a black man is suppose to keep his place. His advice to the innocent Edna prevents others from cheating her and gives her a fighting chance. It also angers those who cannot fathom a black man being smarter than they are.John Malkovich is terrific also as the blind boarder she takes in, who just happens to be the banker's brother-in-law. The three form a bond as they overcome every obstacle together and each helps out to form a makeshift family unit. Field gives a subtle performance as we see her loneliness for her husband and her love for her little boy Frank and his little sister Possum. The scene where she must now take over the disciplinary duties is particularly moving.The hardships of nature are shown as well when a storm suddenly appears out of nowhere and even more suddenly turns into a tornado. Edna barely has time to deal with her sister Margaret's (Lindsay Crouse) marital problems. Wayne (Ed Harris) is having an affair with his wife's best friend Viola (Amy Madigan). All the performances have a realistic feel, capturing perfectly life in a small Texas town during the depression.When Moses helps her make a go of it the racial hatred of the time is shown in a beating that will force him to leave or probably be killed. The scene between he and Edna near the end will surely tug at your heart and anger you at the same time. The anguish of Moses as he knows his time has not yet come is truly the most heartbreaking moment in the movie.This was a landmark film and not to be dismissed. Many have tried to copy this formula but this one is the real thing. The final scene is one you will never forget. This is a film you must own.",5.0,1.0,5,1,-0.2263,negative,0.3312,positive,2008,8,3

622480,B00005JMUK,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,1,2,2004-02-02,An intimate portrait of Aileen Wournos,"I never thought that there would be an actual film based on the first female serial killer Aileen Wournos. I always thought her life was more suited for the Lifetime network. After all her crimes did splash all over the media, especially tv tabloid shows like 'Inside Edition"" and ""Hard Copy"". I was proven wrong when I saw ""Monster"" over the weekend. Long before the Golden Globes, I was curious to see ""Monster"" but after Charlie Theron won best actress for the film, I just had to see it. I am so glad that I saw it. The film is definitely worth the hype and accolades. It annoys me to see people rag on Charlie Theron for being a beautiful woman uglifying herself up for this role. Hollywood as well as the general public has put Charlie Theron in such a corner in terms of her as an actress because of her model looks that it is so undeserving. Charlie can act and not because of her looks either.When I saw the film, what I saw was a gripping, raw portrayal of a woman who was psychologically damaged, so damaged she was beyond help. I would have liked a little more insight into Aileen's personal life and what drove her into such an uncontrollabal fury towards men. At least I was given what was a brief glimpse into the pain that led Aileen to murder several men. Of course what Aileen done was inexcusable and she should not be lumped as a victim like the men she killed. However I do believe that the events in Charlie's life did have an effect on the choices she made in life which includes murdering seven men. Charlie Theron as Aileen Wournos was utterly convincing, not just for the makeup that was provided by makeup artist Toni G. but for her abilities to tap into the soul of what most people consider a monster. A writer for ""Premier"" magazine wrote that he thought the film ""valorizes"" Aileen Wournos (in other words was a bit too biased) and too a certain extent I will agree with that writer because I left the theater feeling rather sympathetic towards Aileen Wournos. Still I know what she did was wrong and should be held accountable for her actions. Up until this film, I never really took Charlie Theron seriously as an actress. Just look at her body of film work. If Charlie continues to pick film roles (Oscar worthy or not) that showcases her broad range in acting abilities, I think she will be around for a long time (which I can't say the same for Mira Sorvino, Hilary Swank, and Marissa Tomei, past Oscar winners for best actress). Christina Ricci was equally good as Aileen's lover Selby Walls. I thought her more subdued performance should have been recognized by both the Golden Globes Awards as well as the Academy Awards. Christina took giant leap of faith to portray Selby Walls, who was easily manipulated and controlled by Aileen as well as her family. Selby was very passive and insecure. ""Monster"" is certainly not for the faint of heart or for people uncomfortable with the subject of homosexuality. There were some really raw, brutual scenes that even made me uncomfortable to watch but the film was so engaging because of the script and the actors involved, I simply let it go. I loved ""Monster"". For all its flaws, I still think it is worthy of five stars no matter what the film's detractors have to say about it.",5.0,0.5,1,2,0.0,neutral,0.9929,very positive,2004,2,2

But Kenny (played by Will Poulter), was the best of the movie. Kenny is the typical stupid guy in a comedy, but finally, this movie shows that a character doesn't have to be annoyingly stupid to be funny, just the necessary when it's needed! I hope to see this guy soon in other movies because he really has the talent.The film counts with unexpected twists that leave the audience shocked, but still making you laugh throughout the whole movie. The only thing that I didn't liked was the ending, I thought it was too predictable, but still enjoyable! Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot.

It's a rare delight, but I watch films for precisely these experiences, and In Bruges delivers the goods in spades. McDonagh's script cracked me up time and again with its dark, harsh humor constantly leavened by weirdly tender moments, and his beautiful direction brings Bruges to life in a very odd yet very wonder-full way.I love that city and have spent some very fine days wandering its cobbled streets and gazing in awe at endless gingerbread vistas out of the 12th and later centuries, and this film takes full advantage of it all. McDonagh had a flash of genius when he set this twisted little gangster tale there, as the contrast and emotional chiaroscuro of the plot dovetails perfectly with the elegant, ancient perfections of Bruges.But what makes this all come alive are the flawless performances of Gleeson and especially Farrell, who I think delivers one of the funniest turns I've seen on celluloid in many years. I laughed myself silly at some of his lines here. You definitely have to enjoy Irish humor and be able to decipher the thick brogues, but if you do and can you will be amply rewarded. There are some outrageously fresh bits, and when Fiennes shows up it all shifts into overdrive and can't be stopped.There is endless ""bad"" language, lots of f's and c's to go around, but that along with the occasional violence somehow seems perfectly apt and never gratuitous. This is both a comedy and a drama but somehow not a dramedy. Perhaps a comma? In any case (dative or what have you), In Bruges worked on every level for me, even the romance. Poesy is perfect with Farrell and their romance is strangely believable, mainly due to her almost slapstick gazes of love. And the deliciously ironic ending has to be seen to be semi-disbelieved.There was nothing that I didn't like about this film...only that it finally ended.Here's hoping for many more in this vein from the fertile mind and perfectly panoramic eye of Martin McDonagh.",5.0,1.0,4,1,0.5106,positive,0.9986,very positive,2010,6,20
284073,6301973232,A2Z1K2I2EYSKFA,5,7,2006-08-17,"Film, Acting, Cinematography: Excellent.","**I tried to make as little known about plot lines; I will try to be as vague about this film as possible.**Night of the Hunter is one of those rare films that hasn't won any awards and simply got stored as a film that doesn't seem to get much play on television. Yet, NOH passes the test of time in such formidable ways. The storyline and believability of the plot and characters remains strong, as does the top-notch cinematography.Film buffs, photography students, and all those who are fans of camera work, please, do yourself a favor; purchase this film, pop some popcorn and then pop the flick in your player, and prepare yourself to be mesmerized by 93 minutes of a film gem. The scenes get better and better as the movie rolls on, and by the time Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gish) makes her grand entrance towards the end of the film, you'll probably have already grabbed your handkerchief or shirt sleeve to wipe away the tears, several times over.How can I impart to film buffs and those who enjoy ""eye candy,"" to please become an owner of this treasure? NOH is rarely spoken of when it comes to must-haves in feature movies. When you see the list of talent, it seems like a quiet film that made its debut in the 1950's, not produced to try for blockbuster status. And people didn't recognize the film then, except perhaps that they didn't embrace its style. It's been over half a century since, and NOH is an opportunity for you to turn off your cellphone and let yourself journey with John (Billy Chapin) and Pearl Harper (Sally Jane Bruce) as they depend on each other to survive what happens within their family.By the time Miss Rachel appears, you simply want to cry on her shoulders yourself. Ms. Gish commanded the performance, and seemed to be the only one (along with John) who had any real common sense to understand the unfolding situations.Fortunately, most of the film seemed to take place in the night, and Stanley Cortez took control of his shots and of the lighting in such extraordinary ways. **slight spoiler info, very slight** One scene worth a note: look past the ""spider's web"" and the other things during the boat ride; put yourself in the mind of a child, and watch them from that kind of perspective, to understand and appreciate these scenes. At first, I was put off by the perspective of some things, but now, I thoroughly enjoy this passage. **end spoils**The interesting thing I observed about NOH is that especially now, this kind of unfolding drama could happen in real life. Nothing in it is beyond reasonable. And that's the chilling thought that coursed through my mind after watching it again. Imagine the point of first contact between John and the preacher. The style of filming is so deep-thought. I also found that Cortez was a photographer, and each scene he composed shows that very foundation.After you watch NOH, place it in an easy-to-get location, because you'll want to watch it again and again. If not for the gorgeously-thought out settings, for perhaps the excellent songs contained within the film.**Some more spoils, about scenes**My favorites:John's first knowledge of Harry Powell when telling a story to PearlHarry Powell with Willa Harper in the bedroomWilla Harper's river scenethe complete dark passage on the riverScene after scene is incredible. You could grab still frames from these and make a beautiful photo album. Someone once wrote that it may have been easier to shoot such scenes with black and white film.

Oliver Stone's screenplay is the ordinary, even trivial, story of the American Dream from a gangster's point of view: from a destitute Cuban emigrant to the most powerful mafia boss on the East Coast, if not the whole country. There are some really memorable lines but they are usually diluted with a good deal of foul language. Brian de Palma does have occasional shots that are singularly illuminating, even haunting, but on the whole he is the most overrated director after Tarantino and Scorcese. Giorgio Moroder's soundtrack is a cheesy semi-trash. The supporting cast is reliable and serviceable enough, but none of the players - and these include Michelle Pfeiffer, Robert Loggia, Steven Bauer, and Mary Elisabeth Mastrantonio - has much chance of making anything memorable.If this movie is a classic - and classic it certainly is - this is solely because of Al Pacino, one of the last actors in possession of genius and charisma prodigious enough to make a whole movie (and a long one) well worth watching for generations ahead. If the brash, bumptious, having tons of ''balls'' Tony Montana has become one of the most iconic characters when it comes to mafia bosses, this is entirely due to Al Pacino's incredibly vivid portrayal of every detail from his make-up: from the Spanish accent all the way to the violent temper. It is incredible that this is the same man who has played the title role in ''The Godfather'', yet it happens to be true. For the cold, extremely sophisticated and highly intelligent Michael Corleone is the very antithesis of Tony Montana who is shrewd and clever, rather than intelligent and sophisticated, and flies into passion at the smallest provocation. Having created these two extremely different faces of the same coin, it is safe to say to say that Al Pacino has done everything there is to be done as far as mafia bosses on the screen are concerned. (Of course ''The Godfather'' is infinitely superior in every other aspect than ''Scarface'', but this is not the point here.)In addition to completely overshadowing a decent, if far from brilliant, supporting cast, the explosive Tony Montana is also the only character in which there is some sort of deeper meaning than the small talk that occupies 95% of the screenplay. There are, indeed, some lines of his (such as those from the embarrassing scene in the restaurant: ''You need people like me so you can point your [*Amazon censorship!*] fingers and say, ""That's the bad guy."" So... what that make you? Good? You're not good. You just know how to hide, how to lie.'') which are almost too smart to be entirely in character. Nevertheless, one is bound to ask: why does Tony Montana fail? And fail he does, in a most pathetic way: after the world almost literally was his, he ended up with more lead in his body than it was used in the Gulf War. (Compare this with the aged Michael Corleone dying peacefully in the yard of his Sicilian house.) The more simplistic explanation is probably the truer one: Tony is victim of his own temperament which knows no restraint. Perhaps, for all his cleverness, there also is some essential lack of astuteness in Tony; even though he ''knows the street'' and ''makes the right connections'' he entirely fails to grasp that Alejandro Sosa is not somebody to screw up your business with. In a way, Tony Montana is a curiously inspiring figure, suggesting that you can achieve everything in this life if you have the character (or the ''balls'', to use his language). And yes, it is dead true that most simple don't have the guts to be what they want to be and have to satisfy themselves with third-rate lives rife with hypocrisies at every corner. On the other hand, if you aim at big money and unlimited power, you should keep in mind that ''balls'' may well put you on the top, but it is only brains that may keep you there.Last but not least, it may be remarked that, sadly, there are some pusillanimous countries (like Germany, for one) where the movie is offered only in a censored version some 16 minutes shorter. The final gunfight melee, the notorious scene with the chainsaw and the one in which Frank met his maker are the parts that suffer most badly, everything that offends the faint-hearted being severely cut; also a lot of cocaine sniffing and the scene of Manny with his bombshell blond in the bed have been left out. Needless to say, this mutilated version is way weaker than the original one. Besides, none of the cut passages has anything really shocking to offer; ever the horrid chainsaw scene, though it does have a lot of blood, is no big deal by the modern standards. I am always amused at such silly censorship today, when kids may easily access on the Web everything vile human nature has to offer.",5.0,0.5714285714285714,1,3,0.3612,positive,0.9704,very positive,2011,6,18

1697109,B00K2CHWOI,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,3,5,2014-06-06,How to train your reset button,"Besides &#34;The Last Samurai&#34; and &#34;Collateral,&#34; Tom Cruise films have always seemed to come up short in some capacity. Perhaps closest to &#34;Oblivion&#34; and &#34;Minority Report&#34; in genre and tone, &#34;Edge of Tomorrow&#34; is just a damn good movie that is exactly the type of explosive entertainment to get the summer season started.The jackets in the film will immediately remind you of the Power Loader Ripley uses in &#34;Aliens,&#34; which seems like a fair assessment to make since Bill Paxton appears in &#34;Edge of Tomorrow&#34; as the humorous Master Sergeant Farell. There's this immediate sensation of cinematic deja vu with &#34;Edge of Tomorrow&#34; that seems to channel &#34;District 9&#34; and &#34;Groundhog Day,&#34; but then the film branches off into more intelligent territory as it adds more detail and depth to its repertoire.The explanation of how the mimics function and the execution of repeating the same day over and over again is where the film really reels you in and surpasses common cinematic fodder. The mimics are like a central nervous system with an alpha and an omega that is like the brain of the entire species. Cage stumbles onto the power when he kills an alpha. Their only means of winning the war is to wait until Cage begins having visions of where the omega is located, which allows the mimics to locate Cage and regain their ability to control time.In addition to its engrossing storyline, &#34;Edge of Tomorrow&#34; is absolutely phenomenal when it comes to its action sequences. That first battle sequence on the beach is extraordinary. There is so much going on that you still feel like you miss something even after seeing Cage relive that moment countless times in the film. The trailer sequence with Cage and Rita driving in a van is also exceptionally raw, gritty, and dangerously combustible.One hindrance standing in the way of making this film an absolutely perfect experience is the way that it's filmed. The camera trembles during moments when a steady camera seems so necessary. The mimics may also be something that grinds your gears. Their design is similar to something you'd see out of &#34;Transformers&#34; and they move so fast that it's difficult for your eyes to process just how it is they move. They tumble at any means necessary and become this unstoppable force that tramples through anything in its path, which almost seems like a metaphor for the film itself.&#34;Edge of Tomorrow&#34; contains intense, pulse-racing action that takes your breath away. The science fiction film is non-stop excitement that never lets up during its nearly two hour duration that goes by in the blink of an eye. Imagine getting really far in a video game with no save points, but then you die after getting farther than you ever have before. You have to start all over repeatedly; that's essentially this film in a nutshell. &#34;Edge of Tomorrow&#34; is the best science fiction film to come along since &#34;District 9&#34; and is what &#34;Battle: Los Angeles&#34; only dreamed of being.",5.0,0.6,3,1,0.0,neutral,0.9352,very positive,2014,6,6

So few films have Maximum Initial Impact, in that they fail to deliver maximum enjoyment on one's first viewing.While Annie Hall certainly bears considerable repeated viewing, it is simply stunning first time through. Apart from the brilliant dialogue and character depth, it contains so many all-too-human touches. I loved the part on the first date when he asks Annie if he can kiss her before they start, just to take away the tension of will-they won't-they kiss, so that they may more easily relax and enjoy their first time out.As a fairly linear romantic comedy, it is unsurpassed, yet there are also many surrealistic elements which give it a quality that one usually associates with European movies.Woody Allen shoehorned so many brilliant and original ideas into Annie Hall that it is staggering to recall that they were all from the same movie. Everything from the Jew-hating grandmother to the kids in his class telling the camera what they ended up as in adult life, serve to keep you off balance, so that you never slide into a ""well I can see what's coming up next"" state of complacency.Allen is a master when it comes to relationships and human failings (and strengths) and his hilarious handling of sexual interactions - ""I'm just trying to work some circulation back into my jaw"" - makes this one of those rare movies in which virtually everybody can find something to make you squirm and say, ""Oh man, he's right"".Annie Hall is classy, it's beautiful, it is full of love, wisdom and compassion, and above all it is utterly hilarious.

You are handsome, sensuous, rich and will be the up and coming power broker in the years ahead. You are also &quot;homosexual&quot;, that dreadful &quot;condition&quot; which if revealed could destroy your little kingdom. What do you do?Maurice explores the above question as we gaze upon two young men who are trying to come to terms with their homosexuality. Clive ( Hugh Grant) is the uptight aristocrat who knows he is gay but attempts to keep it under wraps. One must be practical, you know. Maurice (James Wilby) his lover is unashamed of the relationship and is celebratory of his love for Clive.The two men battle back and forth over what they can and can not do. Maurice goes through his own personal crisis of rejection, questioning and anger in accepting himself as well as trying to receive affirmation from Clive.This is an excellent video on the struggles that these two men have in homophobic England where discovery could mean the end of a career and disgrace. Underlying the emotional turmoil of the two men we find a class issue full of snobbery on both Maurice's part ( his initial encounter with Scudder, a servant), Clive's obsession to achieve and a contempt for women. Clive uses a woman for a cover while Maurice gets enraged over what as he sees as his sister's love for Clive.

720135,B00006L9ZT,A13OFOB1394G31,389,400,2003-02-15,It's not about the acting,"According to the liner notes that accompany this seven-DVD set of Wagner's &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen,&quot; the composer had no time for critics, especially those who liked to point out a certain lack of logic in his musical dramas.(Take that, Anna Russell! - Entire careers have been based on making fun of the Ring Cycle's plot.)This Met version of the Ring under the direction of James Levine might be called 'traditional' by some and 'stodgy' by others.  There are no Siegfrieds in space suits or Rhine Maidens cavorting in front of a hydroelectric dam.  Special effects have been kept to a minimum--a rather tame dragon (although wonderfully sung by Matti Salminen who also is a great, brooding hulk of a Hagen), no goat-drawn chariots, no flying horses.  In fact there are no horses at all, which makes for a slightly surreal funeral scene in 'G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung' where Br&uuml;nnhilde is supposed to sing to her horse, Grane, then ride him into the flames of Siegfried's funeral pyre.However, the Ring isn't about special effects or acting.  It's about Wagner's glorious music.  I've only seen one other Ring Cycle--Patrice Ch&eacute;reau's 1976 Bayreuth production (also out on DVD)--and he (incorrectly, I think) emphasized the stage drama rather than the music.  He also ignored Wagner's mythical setting and tried to turn the Ring into a statement about nineteenth-century robber-barons.Levine's version, stodgy though it may appear, emphasizes the music.  This is the Ring Cycle you want to start with.  It reflects the spirit of Wagner's intentions (if not quite the actual staging), and the singing is excellent.  This is not the dream cast from the golden age of Wagnerian singers, but wait till you hear Jessye Norman as Sieglinde, ringing out her &quot;Oh hehrstes Wunder!&quot; just after her whole world comes crashing down around her.  If this unearthly cry doesn't send chills down your spine, maybe Wagner isn't for you.  One of the other reviewers felt that Norman was too loud for the other singers, but I think just the opposite is true.  James Morris is a complex, ultimately tragic Wotan.  Hildegard Behrens is a brilliant, intuitive Br&uuml;nnhilde. Their final scene together in 'Die W&auml;lk&uuml;re,' as Wotan puts his daughter to sleep within a ring of fire is one of the high points of this Ring.  But the one truly Wagnerian voice in this production belongs to Jessye Norman.If you'd like to learn more about Wagner's Ring Cycle, read &quot;Wagner's Ring:  Turning the Sky Round&quot; by Father M. Owen Lee (highly recommended) or Charles Osborne's &quot;The World Theatre of Wagner.&quot;",5.0,0.9725,1,1,0.0,neutral,0.6053,very positive,2003,2,15

1345350,B003GCMX5Y,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,1,3,2010-07-27,"A treasure trove, a shared love","Stones in Exile, the eagerly anticipated dvd companion piece to the re-release of Exile on Main Street is a fascinating and highly worthwhile document. It is important to point out how the entirety of this dvd constitutes the evidence of my argument. The initial hour long piece must be coupled with the bonus interviews to fully flesh out the history, the mythology, the influence, the timelessness, and the miracle that is the album.The main feature is a sweeping mosaic of photos, old and new film footage, snippets from CS Blues and Ladies and Gentlemen, The Rolling Stones, and scores of interviews that form the overdubbed narrative to the story. We get the history of not only the circumstances but the recording itself including some great background about various tracks which is always fascinating to me. For hardcore fans much of the material has been seen before, but there are many places where you think you've seen or heard it before and realize you haven't. A great example: an infamous photo of Keith playing guitar with Gram Parsons beside him, is now expanded to show how this heretofore assumed private moment was actually going on near a table full of guests, thus the photo and the mental image behind it are totally transformed. Also, you get interviews from some highly unusual and yet truly illuminating participants, some quite accidentally. Listening to the recollections of an eight-year old child's role at Nellcote is at once horrifying and charming. This dvd is full of enough of these treasures to soften even the most bitter Stones' fans who complain of nothing new under the sun. I'm a fair-sized Stones collector and even I had never heard Anita Pallenberg speak of her life with Keith, let alone get some lucid and interesting tales. Speaking of lucid, it's endearing to see how Keith has morphed into Johnny Cash, gray hair and all, speaking with a clarity and frankness that is refreshing.The bonus features rival the main feature in terms of value despite some questionable interview choices. There are two interview sections, one with the band and one with fans. The fan part, ""Exile Pans,"" is an endless hyperbolic homage to the folklore and personal affect the band and this album had on their younger musician fans. The Kings of Leon member and Will.I.Am seem to have the least to offer and I find it hard to believe that there weren't two other artists who came closer to the level of devotion and Stones' fandom that Sheryl Crow and Liz Phair do. Jack White makes some sense too, but the highlight is Don Was providing a very detailed and thoughtful opinion on the album/band's impact as well as giving plenty of insight into his experiences working with The Rolling Stones. I can't imagine any Stones fan not nodding their head in agreement with Was. Ditto for Liz Phair, who may get a bit off-point at times, but nonetheless shares her heartfelt affection and attraction to this album that only the truest fans of a group understand. Hearing rock stars themselves wax poetically about an album that you both share such a deep love for is powerful. At heart, we are all fans and these interviews bring that point home marvelously. My only complaint is that they should have been relegated exclusively to the bonus feature instead of bookending the main piece wherein they seem tacked on and unnecessary.The band interviews go deeper into the explanations touched upon in the feature film and offer a wealth of background, de-bunking and validity to the wildly varying stories that orbit around this work. It is a lovely contradiction to hear them talk in very matter-of-fact terms of what they did versus the breathless confessions of the fans. To the band, this was simply another album to make that had some unusual recording circumstances. To the fans and critics, this represents so much more. Don Was hits on this with his comment about how musicians don't just want to make records that sound like Exile but they want to live that glorified legendary lifestyle. To fans, Exile on Main Street clearly represents so much more than eighteen amazing songs. It stands for excess, bohemianism, sex, drugs, booze, darkness, evil, hedonism, danger, fear, wanting, and desperation, and that's just a sampling. If all Rolling Stones roads lead to Main Street as I believe, it can also be said that those same roads lead outward in a billion different directions to the people this album touches, influences, jolts, comforts, moves, and heals.I have a lot of Stones dvds and I rarely watch them. This is one that I will watch often because there is a shared joy in the whole viewing process. As I watched, I became part of a discussion group of like-minded individuals, united by our love of this epic album. A sense of belonging such as this film creates is a precious thing indeed.What are you doing this weekend, Liz Phair?",5.0,0.3333333333333333,1,1,0.8316,very positive,0.9992,very positive,2010,7,27

153946,0792845730,A2BQBLCKJHP65G,2,2,2008-10-25,Robocop Gets The Justice He Deserves On This 20th Anniversary Edition!,"Back in 1987, I was a fresh High School graduate who already had a vast knowledge of modern day cinema within the Horror and Science Fiction fields. But in that same year I had heard through the grapevine that the company that had released the classic The Terminator was about to unleash another robotic film but with a character on the good side of the Law. And it's title was Robocop. Robocop? Man that sounds corny, my younger self thought. That is until I saw the teaser poster of this half man/half machine getting out of his squadcar, and after that I couldn't wait to see if this film could rival what Orion Pictures accomplished three years earlier with the shaded Arnold.I was not disapointed.To put it simply, Robocop was a masterpiece of late 80's Sci-Fi filmmaking. Directed by Paul Verhoeven, at the time an obscure foreign director with a few cult classics under his belt, and starring Peter Weller, who already had an underground classic Sci-Fi film ""Buckaroo Banzai Across The 8th Dimension"" on his resume, Robocop features Weller as Officer Alex Murphy, a family-man Detroit cop who thanks to the corruption of a weak police force now owned by an evil corporation by the name of OCP, gets gunned down and killed during the line of duty. However, OCP has been toying with the idea of using robotic ways to rule over crime, but with disastrous results in the machine ED-209 created by OCP executive Dick Jones (a surprisingly casted Ronny Cox). But up-and-comer Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) feels his design of half-man/half machine might work better for the project, and since when Murphy joined the force signed all his rights over to OCP, and was already dead, to make him the project's first creation. And thus RoboCop was born. Along the way Robo stops crime dead in it's path, becomes self-aware of the life that is now no longer his, runs into the gang that killed him in the first place, and tries to end the hidden conspiracy within OCP once and for all.Where The Terminator successfully gave us an 80's robot film, it had no heart and soul like the one provided in RoboCop. Murphy/Robo is a hero, full of tangled emotions and an obsession of upholding the Law. Sprinkled throughout is a wonderful sense of humor that it seemed only Verhoeven could provide at the time. There truly isn't one part of Robocop that drags or lets you down. From it's funny modern-day News inserts to it's parodying of it's own Reagan-era greed, Robocop is one film that never gets old and after twenty-years still holds up to today, all without any use of CGI through the special effects of Matte Paintings, Costumes, and Stop-Motion Animation. It's been on DVD several times, through companies like Criterion and MGM, but for it's Twentieth Anniversary MGM pulled out all the stops with an edition that blows away any one before it (including Criterion).Originally housed in a Steelbook casing (current versions come in a standard keep-case with booklet and middle leaf), Robocop 20th Anniversary is a two-disc set featuring two complete versions of the movie, the theatrical and the directors cut extended. To be honest, the difference in time between the two is less than 30 seconds. But within those lost pieces are even more violent graphicness that Verhoeven couldn't get away with the MPAA at the time. It's surprising he got away with what he did because either way, Robocop is one bloody thrill ride. Strangely though, MGM decided to put the theatrical on one disc and the extended on the other, which for a disc released in 2007 seems excessive thanks to modern-day DVD branching that could of had both versions on the same disc. Because of this, it's special features are spread between the two, but these features are definitely worth the purchase alone, and I'm happy to switch discs to see them all. Along with a new entertaining commentary with the crew (a different recording than used on Criterion's), RoboCop 20th also has over twelve new and old featurettes totalling over two hours long. Along with two original 1987 port-over behind-the-scenes & featurettes, four deleted scenes (shot on video for dumping to film as more News inserts), there's also five 2007 new featurettes ranging from a wonderful reflection of making the movie, a great combined interview of the bad guys of the film, and a quaint look-back of how all the now-outdated matte painting and stop-motion effects were created by the original artists today. These alone make this version truly the only version to own. Interviews with Paul Verhoeven, Kurtwood Smith, Ronny Cox, Miguel Ferrer, Ray Wise, and Robocop himself Peter Weller give great and insightful details what it was like being on this set. Not to mention that this version's print is even more remastered than what Criterion or MGM has provided in the past. Skin-tones and black levels have never looked better, all while retaining it's grainy mid-80's filmstock look. Audio is provided in a variety of ways including the original 4.0 mix and a new 5.1 both standard and DTS. In fact, for those that have jumped on the Blu-Ray bandwagon consider that the BD version only has the extended version, the commentary, and a trailer leaving all these great featurettes behind, so if that shouldn't be against the Law, nothing is.In conclusion, Robocop 20th Anniversary is a must own for Sci-Fi/Action fans of any age. An amazing and original story with some of the best practical special effects ever captured on film, it will entertain future generations to come. While the original never got toppled by it's two medicore sequels and 90's television series, those will never take away from what Murphy gave us in the first place.

There is a slight touch of romanticism with the cover-girl, sorry home decorator. There is a little bit more feeling with the father, maybe because the father is playing the father and the son is playing the son, though it remains essentially business, in this case union business. Then there is nothing but buying and selling, owning and dumping, saving and killing, and the  game is only pleasant if it is always both together. To kill one by saving another and to buy one in order to make the other sell and then buy him out. Even the police and justice are used that way. I expose you to the police to humiliate you and have you arrested, but then you trap me for the police with a tape-recorder and you will get a rap on the fingers from the judge while I will get to prison.

Why put us through it AGAIN?! The first Burton/Keaton Batman was da bomb. ""Returns"" was decent, ""Forever"" was entertaining but sadly lacking. Seriously, with a cast like Drew Barrymore, Jim Carrey, Tommy Lee Jones, Nicole Kidman, Val Kilmer, and Kevin Grevioux (Raze of Underworld fame), how could Schumacher screw that up? Well, he found a way, and with the release of ""Batman & Robin,"" it became painfully obvious that the end of Batman was more than just ""in sight,"" it was here.I grieved the death of what could have been a terriffic franchise, and I moved on.Then along comes Goyer. He wrote ""Blade: Trinity,"" and while I am NO fan of that movie, we'll blame the studio's cut and Parker Posey's horrible acting...for now. I will give him the benefit of the doubt because he has also written some great screenplays and stories. Blade, Blade 2, and Dark City are all his, but his writing abilities seem to be more hit-and-miss than substantially consistent talent.Christopher Nolan directs and kicks in his two cents' worth in the screenplay department... I'm not impressed with his body of work. I liked Insomnia, but let's face it: Nothing I'd seen so far said to me that Batman Begins would even be watchable, much less entertaining.To be honest, I didn't even WANT to like this movie for several reasons...* Michael Keaton did so well with Batman* Schumacher was so total in his obliteration of the franchise, I could not see any reason to beat the dead horse* A fan of the ""Dark Knight"" I was tired of being disappointed at the cinema by the direction in which the franchise had goneI must say that I'm very glad I saw this in the theater (on the ""big screen""). Just think; I almost missed witnessing a true rebirth of this franchise!The casting was work of art in itself. Some unlikely choices really REALLY pay off. Two character actors were cast against type, but it seems to have been a brilliant choice!The effects were dynamic, and the sets and backgrounds were more than realistic. The stunts seemed to be more wire work than CGI (thankfully), lending a more believable and realistic feel to this endeavor. And gone (again, thankfully) are the hiddeous nipples from the Bat-Suit! (Curses Joel Schumacher for ever adding them in !!)The thing which most impressed me about this film was the story. It was fantastic! I've read reviews by the ""professional"" reviewers, and one in particular claimed that the movie got lost in the beginning to find itself again only at the end. I'm learning NOT to listen to the ""professional"" reviewers and to judge for myself.I have to say that by going through the changes in the beginning, you fully understand the motivations and abilities demonstrated by the Dark Knight. Because quite frankly, this isn't just Batman anymore. If the new franchise follows this first installment, it will literally BE the Dark Knight vein of the comic book series!

Transferred feelings of rage, bewilderment, abandonment, curiosity, jealousy, and scrutiny.  The viewer feels and understands all of these by way of Caesar, the chimpanzee that is born to a mother whose DNA was changed chemically.  Caesar is on the upward path of evolution and yet the simian whose mind is brighter than man's (at least most men's for the purposes of this movie) is still seen and treated as the chimpanzee he appears to be.  And he is not treated kindly.  So he takes matters into his own hands and quietly turns the tables on his captors while, a la Moses leading his people out of Egypt, leads his fellow apes into the great wilderness outside of San Francisco.  Meanwhile, the viral components that aided the evolution of he and his mother and some other testees is doing quite the opposite to the human population and we are seeing (not graphically, mind you) the very beginning of the near extinction of the human populace and the eventual rise of the immune and now humanly intelligent apes.  Great performances all around (especially by Andy Serkis and John Lithgow).  Sci-fi done right.  Looking forward to the inevitable sequel.",5.0,0.8,2,5,0.6369,very positive,0.3476,positive,2012,6,24

All had varying degrees of technical expertise.  Watched progressively, in order of production, one can see how Anderson & Company improved the technology they used.JOE 90 is a series about a ten year old boy who is allowed to become a super spy by means of ""The Big Rat,"" a machine that transfers the ""brain patterns"" of older, expert people, into Joe's mind.  Certainly, no enemy faction would EVER suspect a ten year old kid of being a threat to their evil plans!!!!!!The plot is silly; the idea of using a kid in this way is handled by the device of having Joe's scientist father act reticent about the spy agency's use of his child, but nevertheless, Joe gets to go to work .... every kids' deepest fantasy in the world of 1960s James Bond and The Man From UNCLE.The puppetry, however, is superb.  Anderson's technicians really shine as subtle human motions and postures are recreated here far better than in any previous series.  This must be the epitome of the Anderson's work if technical expertise alone is the judge.Many earlier series were better by other standards. Thunderbirds will probably remain the quintessential Gerry Anderson series, despite the fact its puppetry is not quite equal to JOE 90's.But as a kid, I never saw JOE 90.  Now, on DVD, I am seeing it for the first time.It's fun, and I can still see why it would have appealed to kids everywhere.The perfect childhood fantasy.

1123052,B000ZN802W,A1QFM9CFEUXZK5,65,75,2008-04-28,Superb Film about Looking so Far for Something that is So Close,"Into the Wild is one of those movies whose images stay with you after the screen goes dark. This is a tribute to the subject-- a tragic and confused young pseudo idealist, Christopher McCandless-- and Sean Penn and his crew.McCandless has just graduated from Emory University. He's bright, well-liked, talented, the world is his for the taking-- it seems. Then he chucks it all, burns his money, abandons his vehicle, donates his graduate school fund to charity and hits the road. He's a leatherfoot, hoofing all across the country from Atlanta to South Dakota, on to California and finally to his goal of the utopian loner's dream world of ""Alaska"". Alaska is quoted here because it represents far more for McCandless than just a remote place full of emptiness and nature. It represents the ""wild"" - that gorgeous and challenging place where he can find himself, or so he thinks.He's on a wild goose chase with himself but doesn't quite understand or realize it. He thinks he's stuffing life and experience and learning into all the time that he has-- he's abandoned everything including his sister and parents. In fact, he refuses to communicate with them at all. Their heartbreak, worry, fears, and frustrations are with us the viewer at all times and we wonder (as do a few characters in the film) silently, ""how can he do this to them""?Chris hits the road hard. He takes odd jobs, and goes from frustrated relationship to the next one. But they always are frustrating because he simply will not give of himself. They aren't frustrating for him, but for those who want to befriend him. His search for personal meaning is truly little more than an avoidance of his own personal demons, mostly from his parents' history and rocky marriage. He is surrounded by love, people who want him, his company, his brilliance and soft, caring approach to the world. He is attractive to others, but he loathes himself somehow. In the wilds of the Alaskan wilderness he thinks he will find what he is looking for and he does, but not in the way that he expected.Again and again, people that Chris meets offer their friendship to him and sometimes their love. But he cannot accept it. Something in him prevents him from accepting love or truly giving it. Perhaps it would be contrary to the loner path that he'd chosen?This is a sad story, so beautifully filmed. The acting is spot on, too.Hal Holbrook plays an old man with a painful secret of his own. He knows that Chris and he are two of a kind and need each other. We in the audience also know this. Holbrook is Chris' chance for stability and a home, the true path to insight for someone whose core issues are built upon a perceived betrayal and lack of love from others, mainly his parents. It's a hard moment for the viewer when Chris walks away from Holbrook abandoning another fortunate opportunity for healing and happiness, but it is not so hard for Chris whose focus is solely on getting to his personal nirvana that he understands and expects Alaska to be.Alaska is a beautiful but challenging place. Superbly filmed, it is easy to see how Chris would want to be there, challenge himself and try to find himself, alone-- try to find a way to fit in with others which is truly the issue-- alone.The exact cause of Chris' death is not fully known. The book's author and Penn both make the case the McCandless accidentally poisoned himself. But later tests on the suspected plant material recovered from his camp site cast serious doubt on this theory as no poison was found.  According to the diaries that he left behind he had decided to return to civilization but a raging river full of spring melt prevented him from doing so. He stayed in his camp, wasting away. But only a mile away was a perfectly usable crossing, and less than half a mile away was a still part of the river where he could have fished to his heart's content with only his hands as the fish were so plentiful there. But he did neither and apparently chose to stay and face his demons and his new understandings alone.It is not clear if Chris is a hero-- the lone introvert heading into the wilderness akin to Thoreau to find the ""truth"", or rather a spoiled city boy with only ignorance and dreams and personal pain and perhaps some mental illness driving him on.The locals in the wilds of Alaska often speak of such people who come to Alaska to find themselves, swollen with pride like the rivers full of melting snows. And they have little respect for them, as they tempt fate and the extreme wilderness and usually lose.McCandless affected everyone he met in a positive way. His writings are those of a young man still trying to understand but so deeply haunted by something he could only identify at the very end that was at the heart of his troubles. The tears of his parents, his friends, and even his own at the end are palatable in this beautiful film by Sean Penn.This is a deeply troubling story of someone who so needed help, was offered it-- but would not or could not accept it.The world is full of Chris McCandlesses going about their daily routines. And perhaps this is why his story has such resonance for so many. He chose to break out of the life he was living, a life that gave him no comfort or solace-- and stride into the unknown to find one that worked for him. It may be a loner's story or a vagabond's tale, but there is a universality about the demons that haunted Chris, and his single-minded yet unfortunate response to them.There is no glory here, and little to reflect upon but the pain of someone who is unable to stop, unable to find another path-- until his dream of Alaska and the wilderness with all its perils was met and its lessons pulled from it at whatever the cost. This is a superb film.",5.0,0.8666666666666667,2,2,0.6249,very positive,0.8793,very positive,2008,4,28

It is the legacy left behind by a troubled people who were enslaved by British authorities to make them subservient to their rule no matter what it wound entail. It is the plight of the Irish people left homeless &#8230;driven from their modest cottages into trenches and later forced to flee from there as well. The Irish were forbidden to speak the Gaelic language and were punished for reading or writing. And were forced into starvation&#8230; with the guns pointed at their heads &#8230; but managed to survive the treachery and the butchery of the British solders. The Irish republican army was formed and the battle to free Ireland and take back their land from British was a turning point to live free or die for it's cause. You will really enjoy this film and reminds us of other cultures like the Jews & Blacks who were also enslaved and forced to flee their homeland as well.

But under the expert hand of writer/director Charles Martin Smith, the film comes out better than the sum of its parts.  I found myself completely drawn in and also learned a lot about survival in the frozen north.  I applaud the director's decision to use an authentic Inuit actress in the main role which made the film seem real.

287626,6301978374,A3BSS2M2DPPV4T,8,9,2001-08-22,QUEEN OF SWEDEN,"Many film buffs agree that this film is the quintessential Garbo movie. The film was tailored especially for the star, and Garbo felt a certain spiritial affinity in playing a monarch of her homeland who lived from 1626-1689. To vintage-film TV watchers, this film is strangely obscure, yet this just might be Garbo's greatest performance (at least a close tie to CAMILLE) in her finest Hollywood film. Like the actress herself, her Christina inspires awe as much as adoration - it is a stunning performance, with her the closing shot being one of the most famed in the history of motion pictures. Salka Viertel, a friend of Garbo, tailored the part for her friend - (Garbo had spent 18 months vacationing in Sweden prior to filming this) - and her Christina is a fascinating, ambiguous, charismatic incarnation. The lustre of this production wasn't dimmed in the least by the equally romanticised albeit easily forgotton THE ABDICATION which starred Liv Ullmann in 1974. The movie owes a great deal of its taste and visual flair to its director, Rouben Mamoulian and the film isn't nearly as dated as one would suppose. The beautifully lit photography by William Daniels is excellent, the sets are eloquent and well-chosen supporting cast is first-rate. Twenty-six year-old Laurence Olivier was originally chosen to play Don Antonio, but he was replaced by John Gilbert, Garbo's former vis-a-vis, both on screen and off. This is his best-preserved sound performance; he would be dead at 38 three years later. QUEEN CHRISTINA met with widespread critical enthusiasm - as did Garbo's fine characterization of her countrywoman - but the film did not tickle the fancy of the hoi polloi during the depths of the depression, and it did badly and the box office, nor it win the awards it merited.",5.0,0.8888888888888888,4,1,0.0,neutral,0.9259,very positive,2001,8,22

Based on the book by the son of one of the original flag raisers, the film not only depicts the full epic of war, but it also delves deeply into the bond drive that followed the publication of the photo, and the ambiguities as to which soldiers, exactly, were in the photograph.The film is scrupulous in trying to tell the truth.  We meet the soldiers and get to know their horrific experience of the war.  And then we get to know the individuals who wound up in the public relations campaign across America.  And, briefly, we meet one of the men as an old man with flashbacks about it all.Iwo Jima was one of the last strongholds of the Japanese.  In preparation of the invasion, the Americans bombed it for weeks until all vegetation was gone and the entire island was a scorched landscape with 20,000 Japanese troops dug in and willing to fight to the death. These battle scenes are shot in desaturated  shades of gray with occasional flashes of orange-yellow flames.  It's very effective, and very frightening, especially since by now we have become acquainted with some of the soldiers.  There's Doc, a medic, played by Ryan Phillipe.  There's Rene, played by Jessie Bradford.  And there's Ira Hayes, a Pima American Indian, played by Adam Beach.  We see fear, we see courage, and we see perseverance.But the battle scenes are only part of the film as later, these three soldiers are wined and dined and trotted across America like pet monkeys.  Rene was offered business deals which he believed were really true.  Doc found himself in the position of lying to mothers about which soldiers were actually in the photograph.  And Ira became a raging alcoholic.The story is complex and doesn't pull punches.  And even though I knew how it would all turn out, the acting and directing were so good that I was engaged throughout even though I didn't actually shed any tears.  But that was not what this film was about.  It was about setting the record straight on an historical event and the photo snapped by an Associated Press photographer that wasn't exactly a spontaneous act.  It's all very fascinating.This is a fine film.  There's a lesson to learn.  And an historical record to set straight.  See it.",5.0,0.88,7,4,0.2263,positive,-0.7509,very negative,2006,11,1

Willow finds an abandoned baby. According to an ancient prophecy, the baby will grow to put a stop to the evil reign of Queen Bavmorda ( Jean Marsh). Since Willow was the one to find the child, he is selected by his village to go on a journey to deliver the baby to safety. Now with only a single swordsman named Madmartigan ( Val Kilmer)at his side, Willow must overcome the the Queen's evil forces of darkness, and keep the baby safe at all costs...With the acception of the Lord of the Ring films, &quot; Willow&quot; has to be the best fantasy film I have ever seen. The story itself is outstanding. Watching a man of Willow's size have to overcome numerous obstacles, is really inspiring. The film also offers non stop action, and tons of laughs. The special effects are out of this world. Especially with all of the sorcery, the two headed dragon, and all of the other creatures. It is all amazing to see. The acting is great all around. Warwick Davis ( known for his role as the Leprechaun), really shines here. He shows fierce courage, determination, and unending love for the baby. Madmartigan might be one of Kilmer's best roles ever. He is courageous, great with the sword, and extremely funny. Joanne Whalley does a nice job a Sorsha. The chemistry between her and Kilmer is outstanding. The two eventually became married in real life. Kevin Pollack and Rick Overton are hillarious as the &quot;Brownie Soldiers&quot; and provide for most of the film's laughs.

As long as one character is based on a real person, they can claim the whole story is based on truth, even if it's a complete fabrication.  The word for this is ""fiction"" and it's a concept with which many reviewers seem to be unfamiliar.  Everyone's getting hung up on this, but it's the movie's central conceit.  You need to suspend disbelief in order to enjoy it; taking a tip from HP Lovecraft, the filmmakers have fabricated ""real"" documents to bolster the illusion of reality in their story.  They had me fooled for a while, but the real tip-off was (SPOILER) the police footage of the murder-suicide by the first hypnosis patient.  No police department in the Western world would ever release video footage of people being killed, and no responsible studio would use such footage in a major release.  It had to have been staged; if you watch the deleted scenes on the DVD you will see that it obviously WAS staged.  This calls all the other ""archival"" footage into question.  If you're still uncertain, then the big reversal at the end should tip off the average-intelligence viewer that they've been watching a hoax.But what a hoax!  Condemning this movie for ""lying"" to you is to miss the point.  It's not a documentary; it's a psychological horror film.  One of the most effective ones I've seen in years.The movie is well edited, beautifully shot .. the story is well constructed .. even though it plays on all the old alien-abduction cliche's, it seems to manipulate the archetypes effectively.  The abduction experience is something that actually happens to people.  What's uncertain is whether these are objectively ""real"" or intense hallucinations.  Whatever causes them, there is no doubt that people all over the world DO have these experiences, and that fact scares the heck out of me.  Though I groaned at the ridiculous ""aliens speaking ancient Sumerian"" bit (just too much to swallow, I'm sorry) the shots of the owls gave me genuine chills .. and most of the time this movie actually unsettled me.  Few films these days can actually do that.  I was impressed.",5.0,0.0,1,1,-0.4767,negative,-0.9719,very negative,2010,11,4

1593175,B009AMANBA,A172YG5D6BXNK,15,20,2013-03-26,Lincoln: Brilliant Historical Epic,"Director Steven Spielberg brings the last four months of Abraham Lincoln's life into this focused historical epic that had been long in the works.As the Civil War comes to an end, and shortly after Lincoln has won re-election, the president is faced with the process of abolishing slavery with his workings to pass the 13th Amendment through a very divided and partisan House of Representatives.  The genuine concern of this issue is palpable through the screen.The film serves not only as a political drama, but a deep character study of the Lincoln family through the turmoil of war, political impasse and the serious emotional impact of life in the White House.  At two and a half hours long, the film has a steadied and deliberate pace that certainly doesn't rush, but is certainly more concerned with maintaining both interest and reveal.Spielberg re-teams with former Munich collaborators: cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, editor Michael Kahn, screenwriter Tony Kushner and composer John Williams.  They were all nominated for Academy Awards for their work on Lincoln.  The production design, costume design and editing are absolutely remarkable, as big-budget historical epics rely on the excelled success of depicting the past, telling a story out of time, and making it feel and look accurate.  Lincoln succeeds in a great manor.When it comes down to the film, however, more than Spielberg's directing, the impact of the film relies on the layered and masterful performances of its actors.  Daniel Day-Lewis obviously won his third Best Actor Oscar for his role as the president.  He is a powerhouse throughout the whole film, yet, in his chameleon way, he strives for the restrained dignity and humanism of his character.  However, David Straitharn, Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Field, John Hawkes, and Hal Holbrook all give absolutely masterful veteran performances as well.  James Spader and Joseph Gordon-Levitt also deliver noteworthy performances.  This is clearly an ensemble film cast and finished by the hands of a master.The dark, brooding look and feel of the film is paired perfectly with its serious, conversational tone.  This is yet another masterwork from Spielberg, which, at this point in his career, his audience never expects anything less.I watched part of the film on my laptop and the second half through my Playstation on the big screen.  The streaming was clear and the sound was even better, probably not as good as the Blu-ray release, but it didn't disappoint. The nuances of the accents and the breaths between the speeches and stories are affecting and rousing.Great film, highly recommended.  One of the few films I had no qualms paying as much as I used to at the video store to watch.  I would love to re-watch in Blu-ray, which always says something about a film that is worthy to view multiple times.",5.0,0.75,1,10,0.5859,positive,0.9976,very positive,2013,3,26

As opposed to portraying a central character with either a fixed purpose or definite goal, Federico Fellini introduces the audience to Marcello Rubini, an Italian tabloid reporter who struggles to find meaningful aspirations in life.Adeptly played by Marcello Mastroianni, Rubini is not the type of leading role personality that many audiences will be frequently exposed to. He is neither protagonist nor antagonist. He is, instead, a juxtaposition of paradoxes. For instance, he comes across as a great Italian lover who has finally found the woman of his dreams, only to rediscover hours later that he cannot commit himself to any one person. Throughout, Rubini constantly puts himself in start-and-stop modes, implicitly advertising himself as a socialite one day only to withdraw himself into utter isolation later in the evening.From one scene to the next, Rubini seems to want to reach out to those around him, but for some reason, he ultimately decides not to. It is as if he has an invisible wall that somehow separates himself from the rest of society, and the perceived complexities that he either creates for himself or else are created for him evolve and never seem to subside. Perhaps the movie was a parallel to a mid-life crisis phase that Fellini was about to enter.Near the conclusion, Rubini is essentially faced with a decision that one might extrapolate as a Heaven or Hell option. Either way, it seems as if Rubini will continue his course only to change routes and then pass from one interest to another. One might argue that he is a hedonist, but Rubini, to me, is not exactly that. He is like the dog who loves the wheel and will get up close to it but not close enough for contact.La Dolce Vita, interestingly enough, means The Sweet Life. However, I don't think that Rubini's life would be described as sweet, but it would not be classified as bitter. Just as Rod Serling's Twilight Zone was described as a world between shadow and substance, Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita, though not an episode with any fifth-dimensional references, is an interesting portrayal of a man whose role in life seems to fall somewhere between participant and observer. And this facet which, perhaps, plays to the strengths of the movie's brilliance would not be the most useful tool in this age of shallow, Hollywood blockbusters.All in all, five for five for La Dolce Vita. It is an interesting and highly daring focus on early 1960's Italian pop and underground cultures that might come across as shocking to some viewers over forty years later.Viva La Dolce Vita!",5.0,0.6666666666666666,2,1,0.4404,positive,0.9914,very positive,2004,11,12

Tony and his friends soon discover the world of cocaine and begin selling it. Tony builds an empire out of this business and eventually becomes a very powerful man. However, all of the power soon comes to an end when a hit is placed on him. The climactic scene at the end (containing the now famous line, &quot;say hello to my little friend!&quot; will leave you in awe!Al Pacino gives what I believe is an Oscar-worthy performance as Tony Montana, while the very young Michelle Pfeiffer portrays his cocaine-addicted wife. The film can quite violent at times and very strong language is used often, so you might want to put the kids to bed before watching this one.The second disc containing all of the special features is a gem within itself. It contains deleted scenes, how the film came to fruition, and a short documentary about how &quot;Scarface&quot; has influenced many of the hip-hop artists today.Overall, I would give this film and its special features 10 stars. Even though Tony chose to go into the business of cocaine, it shows how a person coming from virtually nothing can become one of the most power people in the country if his or her drive is strong enough. Like the movie says, &quot;The world is yours!&quot; I would highly recommend this film to anyone with a DVD player.

Tolkien's classic trilogy.  With the Extended Edition, it is apparent how much footage Peter Jackson had to let go.  And what great additions they make.  The first twenty minutes leads straight into Hobbiton from the prologue read by Cate Blanchett.  However, the introduction and attention to Bilbo and Frodo's relationship is played out in a series of crucial scenes, not to mention a lengthy voiceover from Ian Holm.  With the presence of the voiceover we are bridged from the events from &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.  There is a great cut scene with the stone trolls Bilbo tells terrified young Hobbits about earlier at his birthday.  Amazingly, Aragorn and the quartet of Hobbits break out in songs...of Elvish love tales and drunken glee, respectively.Gandalf also has some momentous scenes that appear here, namely one which explains why he can slow time with his booming voice...&quot;the tongue of Mordor, which I will not utter here.&quot;  At Rivendell, Boromir approaches the ring with much more confusion to which Gandalf speaks in Mordor, and the same effect is used.To make a long story short, there is little self-indulgence on this DVD.

It was then that Jackson wrote and directed a masterpiece called &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; that introduced two terrific actresses, in Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet to the world.  The irony is that Jackson could not afford to work with Winslet after &quot;Titanic&quot;, and now he is sitting on top of the world.  His unique visual style (lots of animation without pandering to the G-rated mainstream) combined with his courage to tackle difficult subject matter is what commands the kind of respect he deserves.

This movie was my favorite of the three, The Two Towers my least favorite, The Fellowship of the Ring my second favorite.  (The timing of the release of The Two Towers kind of gave me the creeps).  This film was meant to be the grand finale, and Peter Jackson, the Academy winner in 2003, pulled it off.  The supplemental dvd explains a little about the behind the scenes work that went on and explains how faithfully Peter Jackson tried to create the story as the book describes it.  I read the entire trilogy as a child when I was 10 or so years old, (a long time ago)!  Haven't read it since, yet as I watched the whole series, I began to remember how I had pictured the story in my mind as I had read it decades ago and began to recall (vaguely) what I had read.  I think that's a testimony, to me at least, of Jackson's work.  (I don't recall the Aragorn/Arwen love story at all; I think Jackson just threw that whole thing in the trilogy to spice things up a bit!)  As much as I love watching Orlando and Viggo, this movie to me was a movie about hobbit heroism, and I loved watching the close friendship that had to develop between the hobbit foursome during this perilous quest especially in this last film.  None of the actors got any awards for this movie, yet nearly all the behind the scenes crew did.  Jackson did a spectacular job all around, and was very careful in picking a cast that would work well together during the 3-4 years it took to complete the Trilogy filming.  The Lord of the Rings was written by J. R. R. Tolkien, published in 1954.  What I loved about reading the trilogy, was how Tolkien portrayed good and evil throughout the work.  The story, yes, and especially in The Return of the King, is about the battle between good and evil, the hobbits, the elves, and humans versus Sauron and his evil band, yet there is evil within the heart of everyone as Frodo (Elijah Wood) must grapple with the ring's power to stir up this covetous/idolatrous character flaw within us all.  It's no wonder that Tolkien was raised christian, and this constant inner battle is analogous to the working of the Holy Spirit, the process of sanctification, within those who have given their lives to Christ.  I was on the edge of my seat during the final battle scene, nearly moved to tears.  My favorite scene was the one where Pippin (Billy Boyd) sings a song a capella whilst the battle rages.  No one ever mentions that scene or his singing, but I was really moved by it.  So many of the actors were not top billing in any movies before The Lord of the Rings, but they all performed so well.  Would that these furry-feeted people really existed, would that the world resembled the hobbits' shire.",5.0,0.6666666666666666,3,7,0.0,neutral,0.9433,very positive,2005,4,10

The truth is people that where as slow as his character was would have been given a General Medical Discharge after attempts such as being sent to special training with others that where slow or had other issues, restart boot, but not kept to the obvious inability to cope as his character displayed. For the most part if you kept up, you where ok, but there where those that could not deal with the shock of boot camp, or sadly where not ready for what they gotten them selfs into.Lee Ermey obviously new his role well and played it to perfection and was another stand out, in my experience you honestly learn to respect your instructors, and after awhile, it really wasn't that bad.

If you want to succeed in society, you have to fake it --- cover up your miss-spent youth, or put it behind you,  don a front of respectability, hide your flaws. This is the way society operates, and two-faced old Dad has it figured out. Only show the acceptable side of your face, and you've got it made. One of the best things about this movie is that Brando managed to kick Kubrick the cube off the set. Many of Kubrick's films show the individual being flattened by society's values: and the individual is often shown as being demented or vicious beyond redemption in the first place. Instead of the heavy-handed Kubrick treatment, Brando gives us a sensitive, nuanced, moody, brooding, highly romantic, subtle and poetic story which perfectly fits the locale and the Mexican Western genre. Brando is great, as nearly always in his earlier work: 80% languor and 20% explosion. Malden, as always, is nothing less than 110% professional. To be beautiful, however, you have to suffer; and, boy, does Brando suffer. You have to ask yourself if he finished up working for the government in Oregon, leaving nothing but a little memento South of the Border. With five hours and a million feet of film in the can, you also have to ask yourself about possible alternative endings. For instance, did Malden get in a deadly shot from behind the fountain? Or did he shoot the girl in the back, and kill the baby, before the couple made their getaway? That would have been just too audience unfriendly in 1961.I've now read pretty well most of the internet reviews of this movie, and the only one which halfway recognizes its power is the London Time Out piece by TM. Check it out, and you begin to get some idea of why OEJ is a great work. Time will tell. Its reputation can only grow.",5.0,0.8333333333333334,2,1,-0.128,neutral,0.9842,very positive,2006,3,27

I'm surprised no one has pointed out the Clark/superman metaphor. While some were confused about Gere's role and casting, I thought it to be a very appropriate. After I thought about it.Imagine Clark as the alter ego of the Superman, who violently visited Japan 50 years ago using superpowers against them needlessly, now returning as his meek understanding alter ego. While most of the younger Japanese look at him as a generation removed from supermans vicious destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, others however know his true identity and are understandably nervous around Clark. They make it a point, conspiring to NOT upset Clark. They do business with Clark now. After all the end result of upsetting Clark could cause a re-appearance of Superman.Towards the end of the film, one of the kids (they all wear american t-shirts(costumes)are in awe of Clark and his American power, or mystique) points to a plane which has just taken off and says ""Look! it's Clark"".When you take that into account ""The Bad Sleep well"" may have been Kurosawa's realistic reaction to Batman.Did you know Gere was considered for the role of Superman in the 80's?

Instead, it is a very good psychological drama.  Lila is a very troubled girl, one who expresses her inner insecurities in sexual fantasies.  Chimo is a nominal Muslim teen, who is trying to balance his own dreams in life with the low expectations of his Arab friends.Although Lila seems to be extremely loose sexually, Chimo's reaction is a teen's typical sexual insecurity.  On the one hand, he finds this opportunity fascinating and tempting; on the other hand, he is unsure of how to handle it, so he draws back.  He also, to his credit, seems to sense that Lila is very troubled, and acting out sexually would only exacerbate her problems.  This is an excellent movie for parents to show teens if they believe their son or daughter are encountering such a person as Lila.  Teens need to understand that many troubled teens express their psychological problems sexually, and taking advantage of that will only make things worse for the troubled teen.  Parents might also wish to discuss how it would affect their teen if what they did complicated another teen's problems.",5.0,0.4,3,1,0.6249,very positive,-0.683,very negative,2007,1,3

630080,B00005JNEI,AKZ1Q9S0Z3G6V,23,28,2004-07-30,Bowling for Bush,"It opens up semi-quietly, showing Al and Tipper Gore celebrating a &quot;Florida Victory&quot; after the 2000 election with a huge crowd of supporters. We don't really hear them cheering and having a great ol' time, though. Instead, we hear director Moore lamenting about how the last four years have seemed like a big dream and to many of us in the audience who were ready to see this movie, it does indeed feel that way. I still remember George W. Bush making promises and proclaiming that he would &quot;be a uniter and not a divider&quot;. He also said he would bring dignity back to the White House...You can call this film a &quot;tired liberal argument&quot;, a &quot;liberal soapbox&quot;, or anything else that comes to mind, but you would be wrong on just about every front. Michael Moore may be a liberal, but he didn't say that liberals have the solution to everything. His interviewee's say that and some of the war-injured say that and the mother whose son was killed over the current struggle in Iraq say that. Moore's whole idea is to say that the man we have serving us in the White House is NOT the man for the job. For this, I applaud Moore and I call him a braver man than I. He hangs not just his private parts out there but his entire body.Michael Moore's documentary makes intelligent connections between the Bush White House and Saudi oil interests which include the Bin Laden family. He claims that one of Cheney's companies made a profit off of 9/11 due to new war contracts. He shows us that the war in Iraq is both unneccessary and quite deadly mainly because Saddam Hussein has nothing to do with 9/11 and never had the tools that terrorists would love to get their hands on (the famed &quot;WMD's&quot; that have become a household name).Of course, none of this will come as unfamiliar news since we have all heard the crazy things viewers have said about Moore and his ability to &quot;stretch and distort&quot; certain truths. Here, I've seen Moore do nothing other than what any other documentary filmmaker would do: persuade you to believe his viewpoint by shooting archival facts your way and showing you why you should care about it now. He has the right, as an American, to question his government. Everyone (even the Repub's) exercised this right not once(in 1992), not twice(in 1996), but THREE TIMES (in 2000). We do so everytime we vote. You will probably do it again in 2004 when you choose your leader for the next four years.What Michael Moore does NOT do is exactly what Pro-Bush sheep say he and most liberals do: Michael Moore does not hate our military. He does not use 9/11 to his advantage or to any other advantage. He follows the military on their exploits with curiosity and then questions why they continue to fight a war that doesn't need to be fought when the MILITARY begins to complain to the camera. Moore also meets a nice woman named Linda Lipscomb who works in the Unemployment Office in Flint, Michigan, the subject of Moore's very first movie. Her son has gone to war in Iraq and she supports him and the reason the troops fight all the way. She even confesses that she misunderstood the anti-war protesters, saying that she considered their protests as &quot;a slap in the face&quot; until she realized that they were protesting the reason Bush led us in there.Later in the film, we discover that her son was killed in Karballah in a Blackhawk helicopter downed by enemy fire. She no longer supports the war or Bush and her and Moore take a march up to the White House which is almost cast as a big, powerful building that taunts its opponents. It's been fenced off completely (due to construction) so nobody can even approach the gates and that's when Linda's emotions begin to get the best of her as she sobs uncontrollably, remembering her son, doubling over in an almost painful way. This brought tears to the eyes of many an audience member, including me. Not because I don't like the war but because you realize that actual human beings are needlessly dying.Moore also does NOT sympathize with terrorists. He wisely does not show what we have already witnessed hundreds of times: the planes crashing into the World Trade Center. Instead, he lets us HEAR it with just a dark screen to keep us company. He points out that over 3,000 people, even a friend of his was killed in the attacks. He points out that Bush rightly sent troops to into Afghanistan to &quot;smoke 'em out&quot; (repeated over and over by Bush in a cleverly-edited sequence) but that he sent only a mere 11,000 troops. This is incredibly alarming since, a) Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban are supposedly still alive and well in Afghanistan and b) just under 1,000,000 troops are in Iraq, fighting seemingly multiplying insurgent forces everyday.Michael Moore's film takes you on an emotional journey that will force you to laugh, make you cry, and encourage you to get mad and do something about the sad state of affairs in this country. This, despite what others will no doubt say, is a very important film and one of immense patriotic passion and such power that you might find that you've made an impression of yourself in your theater seat by the movie's end.**** out of ****--Matt(Note: There are two sides to every story. Many call Moore a liar. The National Review's Dave Kopel has written an article apparently showing the &quot;deceits&quot; in the film (59 of them, he claims) but Kopel does not often address the heavier claims made by Moore's film and hits on the minor ones. Because of that, it would be easy to call Kopel &quot;deceitful&quot; and &quot;manipulative&quot; as well.)",5.0,0.8214285714285714,2,6,0.0,neutral,-0.9918,very negative,2004,7,30

The freshness remains 21 years on and there is also now the added commentry on 80's life.A time when fear of the world's demise began to ring home and as such affected a disillusionment in western youth at perhaps a greater a degree than ever before seen.This is strikingly in evidence here and it is aided and embelished by a range of powerful, candid and comedic performances.Truly the pinnacle by which all other teen anxst films and shows should be judged.",5.0,1.0,1,2,0.5719,positive,-0.7706,very negative,2006,3,12

Kevin Conroy returns as Batman and Tim Daly returns as Superman. I was never a big fan of Supergirl but this film's portrayal of her is amazing. The plot focuses around her crash landing to Earth as Superman's cousin Kara Zor-El. While she tries to understand herself and decide her path, chaos erupts around all the heroes. Wonderwoman is also featured here and also blew away my expectations of her; she is fierce and engaging. The main villain that the heroes have to face off against is one of the most powerful and interesting villains in the DC Universe, Darkseid (voiced by Andre Braugher who does an amazing job).The writing is absolutely amazing and there is no shortage of great action sequences. Every character is done justice in this movie and their strengths are magnified as well as their weaknesses. The film ""Public Enemies"" was an extremely good predecessor but it left me wanting more. ""Apocalypse"" is an amazing conclusion to the 2 movie story arc. I think that individually, this movie is the better of the two and that's saying a lot.I highly recommend this but I suggest you buy the 2-Disc set with both movies that's featured on here because they really do go together in my opinion (not to mention it's cheaper).",5.0,0.0,1,1,0.0,neutral,0.9908,very positive,2013,8,20

734379,B000087EYI,A1COW0UIB5HA9J,1,1,2011-08-18,Another amazing collection of episodes,"Rhino continues off from part 1 where they bring selected episodes from the beloved cult TV show and possibly my fave show of all time knwon as MST3K which is Mystery Science Theater 3000 for short. Michael J. Nelson and Joel Robinson (Joel Hodgeson) with their robot pals Crow T. Robot (Trace Beaulieu) and Tom Servo (Kevin Murphy) with the help of Gypsy and Cambot are still in space being taunted by Dr. Clayton Forrestor (Trace Beaulieu) and assistant Frank (Frank Coniff) as they throw them some stinky films to watch.Starting off with ""Angel's Revenge"" it seems the boys are watching an unsexy attempt at an exploitation ""Charlie's Angels"" wannabe movie that stars Jack Palance, Jim ""Mr. Magoo"" Buckuss and Alan Hale Jr. as it features a group of women and a teen girl who are trying to fight a drug lord. The movie is bad as it has one hot chick played by a playmate but the rest of the film is pure mind boggling awfulness that only the boys can sink their teeth into, i like how they did some funny sketches like one that spoofs 70's exploitation called ""Chocolate Jones"".Second comes one of my fave episodes called ""Cave Dwellers"" from the third season which is originally called ""Blade Master"" that is a sequel to ""Ator The Invincible"", it's a 1984 Italian-US barbarian fantasy epic with Miles O'Keef as Ator as he is joined by an oriential warrior called Thong (Chen Wong) and lovely female warrior Mila (Lisa Foster) as they must rescue the girl's uncle from a tyrant (David Brandon) who has a special device that can hurt humanity. Cave Dwellers was one of my first MST3K videos i purchased back in 96 at 15 and has been one of my fave episodes ever, this is one's humor is terrific including original one-liners Crow does for Ator in the film and how they are amazed by that amusing hang-glider sequence in the film.Next comes the best episode in my opinion of the show ever that has became a beloved one since 91 on it's third season called ""Pod People"". After doing an invention exchange as sometimes even with the Baddie's public domain karaoke machine they are being punished by watching a bizarre but faulty 1983 Spanish Sci-fi film called ""Pod People"" directed by Piquor Simon of ""Pieces"" and ""Slugs"" fame as it's a cross between John Carpenter's The Thing and ET about a meteor from space that lands in the woods somewhere as some boy who lives with his uncle and mom witnesses as 2 hunters go after it, get killed by a weird anteater-esque alien that goes on the loose and the boy raises the alien's baby as a rock group from the big city go into the woods for a sexual holiday until it turns into a nightmare. A brilliant episode with great jokes mainly from ""Cheif and McLoud"" and how they make fun of the movie during the segments.Finally ""Shorts Vol. 1"" features a collection of 7 amusing educational short films such as ""Grooming and Body Care"", ""Why Study Industrial Arts"", ""Junior Rodeo Daredevils"", ""Chicken of Tommorow"", ""A Date with Your Family"", ""Home Economics Story"" and ""Cheating"" which the boys riff on.",5.0,1.0,6,1,0.5859,positive,0.9964,very positive,2011,8,18

IF you do not own this film, the $15 spent on the new blu (or $25 digibook) will likely be a good investment. Whichever release you get, a great film awaits!

I'd always wonder ""How in the world can you connect with an artist THAT much?""  Those were the days before I was old enough to understand what music can do to someone's soul.  Marvin Gaye makes my heart beat faster and my eyes water. I am CRAZY about that man's voice. When I walked into a bookstore, I snatched this DVD up so fast you would've thought I was on fast forward.His voice is beautiful and the emotion that comes out of him is outstanding. The first six performances were frustrating for me to watch because it showed how strong segregation was.  The audience was predominantly white and the atmosphere very stiff, but I wanted to hear his songs.  Even in an audience that seemed to look at him as more of a puppet than respect him as an artist, he went into his own little world and boooooooy, did he sing those songs.  When I got to #7 ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" and saw his very lustful performance with Tammi Terrell...that was IT.  It was what I'd been looking for all along.  Those two looked like they wanted to get a room and stop the song, and I cracked up. I felt like I was sneaking and watching the performance, but they didn't know they were live.  I'll tell you one thing...those two must've made one helluva couple!Every single song he sang moved my spirit and made me dance around the room, but the two that stood out most to me were ""What's Going On?"" when they showed how black neighborhoods looked, how the war was treating the world, the bungalows reminded me of my old neighborhood, and he was so vulnerable in the song.  The second song was my all-time favorite song in the world ""Let's Get It On.""  HE DID THAT SONG!  That man sang that song like a woman was standing right in front of him...I wonder what kind of actor he'd have made, because you couldn't tell me he wasn't doing one helluva an acting job imagining what he'd do to that woman.  When he started whispering at the end like he was trying to coax her into going into the dark...wow.There is no better R&B; artist than Marvin Gaye, in my eyes. He has the soul, the heart, the spirit, the class, and the voice of an artist that could move through any decade and still be THE top artist. I really wish he'd have had the chance to do more songs...but I don't know what made his father do what he did and I'm not here to judge that.  I didn't know him personally and can make no judgments about his personal business. But I do know, as an artist, there is no one I love more than Marvin Gaye.",5.0,1.0,2,1,0.6369,very positive,0.9832,very positive,2006,4,23

Will watch it soon and will need a hanky again. I saw the movie on TV and taped it on my VCR about 15 years ago. Its not a very good print, so the DVD Criterion version will be good. Good for Criterion that they reproduced this movie which is long overdue. It's a great movie which has been ignored too long. I found the movie hard to watch at times as its so sad in many places. The struggle for the old couple to try to remain together and the selfishness of their children who, as one other poster said, seem to focus more on the parent-child relationship and not on the relationship of their father and mother who are also man and wife and existed as a couple before the children were born. The couple were very close and had a great amount of love and respect for each other that had nothing to do with their children. This movie is still as important today as it was when it was made way back in 1937. It's a wonderful movie. Victor Moore is fantastic (he was also good in ""It happened on Fifth AVe."" which was released not long ago and I got it as soon as it came out). Beulah Bondi is such a good actress. Her acting in the movie is superb. The sadness in her voice when she realizes she and her husband will not be going on together, truly touches your heart. I loved the part in the hotel near the end.

This is especially noticeable with sequels.In the case of the the American President and Dave combination, each of these movies stands alone as a classic for the future. Together, they are ideal for any collector.Each of these movies has comedy and romance that is well written and well acted. Yes, they have one other thing in common. One of the major characters is serving as a fictional President of the United States. However, neither of these stories is just a rip off of the other or a rewrite of the same story.The American President looks at the life of a widow and father, who just happens to be the man in the White House. The politics of re-election, while the world watches him fall in love is the subject. Michael Douglas is a very believeable President, and Annette Bening is a somewhat less talented love interest.On the other hand, Dave tells of a Presidental look-alike who finds himself suddenly playing the role 'for real'. Again, the world watches, while the main character falls in love with the real First Lady. The great comedian, Kevin Kline, is the perfect common man's version of the President; and Sigourney Weaver plays the part of First Lady to perfection.",5.0,0.5,1,1,0.6249,very positive,0.9945,very positive,2008,4,26

The movie is the combined effort of regular collaborators Tim Burton, Jonny Depp, and Helena Bonham Carter. The film has Tim Burton's signature style all over it with its dark macabre look, its dark macabre romance, and its dark macabre everything else. But that's okay because it works.Probably the first thing people will notice about the movie is that it's a musical. Though you don't usually think of serial killers and musicals at the same time, Sweeny Todd really makes it work and the music, credited to Stephen Sondheim, is excellently written. The performances in Sweeny Todd are very good as well. Jonny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter work wonderfully together while Alan Rickman and young newcomer Ed Sanders do extremely well also.This is a great movie and I highly recommend it. The level of violence may get to some people (not many these days) but if that doesn't bother you then by all means, see it.

While I was watching it I was so grateful someone actually invested the money to make this film because it is that rare film you can just turn the sound off (or play only the soundtrack) and give the eyes a feast.Tom Cruise gets a bad rap, and I think unfairly, because of some of his 'antics' and his religion. I don't really care about either. His antics have never hurt anyone and, so far as I know, his religion hasn't either. Yes, I know there are allegations of abuse but that is true of any religion and any atheist group, as well.But he delivers yet again another terrific performance, something he has done more consistently than any actor over the past 30 years. The rest of the cast, but I have to point out maybe the most surprising performance in the film and right up there with Cruise, that of Andrea Riseborough as Victoria.I think the 'scavs' were a disappointment, however, and that is why I take off half a star.Yes, Morgan Freeman is good but they never seemed real to me within the confines of the universe the director had created. Small criticism since they really aren't as prominent as they should have been but no spoilers here. I was able to watch the film without any foreknowledge and I enjoyed it as such. I wouldn't want to ruin that for anyone.The ending? There are great and surprising moments leading up to the penultimate scene in the film. It is an odd scene which is by turns stunning and somewhat pedantic. It didn't rise up to the level of the expectations I had built. But I enjoyed the ride so much getting there that I didn't matter. And I have to admit I did enjoy the very final scene even though I saw it coming.The extras are very good. Tom Cruise is always interesting in his commentaries as he is here with the director.

1370092,B003X413JW,A1NF9WS7RR82MX,1,1,2011-03-14,Ten Stars Out of Five!,"I've had these DVD's for a few months now, and I think this is one of the best metal performances ever recorded. From the execution of the songs, to the production values of the show, to the set list itself, this collection is outright amazing. In a nearly three-hour concert, Opeth delivers the entire Blackwater Park album and the best-chosen selection of songs imaginable from each of their other albums almost flawlessly. They chose some of their longest, most complicated arrangements for the set, showing a true dedication to the metal genre, and even proudly mentioning during the concert that they have brought death metal and blast beats to the Royal Albert Hall for the first time ever. Here are some brief highlights:Akerfeldt--He's supremely cocky, but also with a wry, self-deprecating humor throughout the show. But when he jokes about Steven Wilson telling him he's a genius songwriter, you have to acknowledge the truth behind the joke. His playing on these songs is incredible, and his vocals are spot-on. The earlier songs, like Forest of October and Advent, sound almost identical to the original recordings. Meanwhile, his clean vocals on every song sound better than I've ever heard them, especially on The Moor, which is one of several performances on this DVD that gave me chills. He's the main reason Opeth have established themselves as arguably the most talented and innovative band to be spawned by the death metal genre.  (Note:  Mikael remains silent during the Blackwater Park set, but interacts with the crowd during the second.)Mendez--As usual, his playing is mesmerizing, and he's exceptional on those older tracks. Advent was the song that originally got me into Opeth, largely because of the crazy-sounding bass parts, and even though he wasn't in the band then, he perfectly replicates the unique bass sound of the first two albums, and that song in particular.Wiberg--Great moustache! Pretty good keyboard playing, too.Axe--He handles all of the old material without a hitch, even adding a blast beat to the end of Wreath, which sounds great. And his performance on The Lotus Eater is face-melting.Akesson--The new guy plays all of Blackwater Park and one song each from every other album, and the band sounds as potent, well-rehearsed, and tight as ever, if not more so. Plus, he gets points for wearing an Entombed shirt throughout the show, gracing Royal Albert Hall with a nod toward one of the pioneers of Swedish metal and one of my all-time favorite bands. Kind of ironic, though, that the only flaw of the whole show comes on the one song that he actually recorded with the band, The Lotus Eater. But after close to three hours of perfection, I'm not going to nitpick anything.This show looks great and sounds great, and I'm sure just about every Opeth fan will love the set list, which, other than the Blackwater Park songs, consists of tracks not present on Lamentations or The Roundhouse Tapes (one exception; Hope Leaves is included to preserve the chronology of the set). Not only that, but they picked some 11- to 13-minute monsters, like the ones already mentioned and Harlequin Forest, that leave you speechless after seeing them played with such skill.

The scene where Fred and Barney are about to be thrown into the pit and the diabolical Dr. Sinister drops a rock into the pit and tells them it is bottomless. If Maxwell Smart were in a sittuation like this, he would say &#34;The old rock in the pit trick and now you're gonna tell me that the pit is bottomless.&#34; Of course the villain would say, &#34;You see Mr, Smart, the pit is bottomless.&#34; Then Maxwell Smart would say &#34;I told you not to tell me that!&#34; Of course Fred and Barney manage to escape by giving the henchman a judo chop. Then they give Dr. Sinister's guards all a judo chop. Then the next villain they meet up with is Billy The Kidder, a well known caniving cowbgoy of crime just like Shame on Batman. Fred Flinstone gets kicked out of the house by the Boulderettes as the caterer who sends the wrong acts to the different locations.

1631586,B00BEIYOHC,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,0,0,2013-12-31,BRIDE IN BLACK RETURNS,"There are few directors who can make a truly scary movie. I'm not talking about the run of the mill movie where something jumps at the camera, the music screeches and you feel that instant adrenalin rush from what happened. I'm talking about a scary movie that has a few of those moments perhaps but that has something deeper about it that makes you walk out of a theater or turn off the DVD player and wonder if something terrifying from the screen didn't walk off and stay by your side. James Wan is a director whose name you might not know but who makes movies exactly like that.Wan first came to notice when he co-wrote and directed a small low budget film you may have heard of called SAW. Things he did in that movie, his creative use of light and shadow, of wringing a story to get everything out of it, can be found in the other films he's done in follow up. In 2010 he made another horror film called INSIDIOUS. The story of a haunting that wasn't of a house but of a boy was a hit with movie fans that made it a successful release. It ended with the boy and his father leaving the Further, a not quite limbo between the worlds it the living and the dead, and returning home safe and sound. Or did they?INSIDIOUS 2 comes out on DVD this week to answer that question. Picking up immediately where the first film ended, Josh and Renai Lambert (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne) stay at his mother's house since their old house is now a crime scene with the death of Elise Rainier (Lynn Shaye), the spiritual investigator that helped rescue them. Within minutes of trying to go to bed things begin to happen. Renai is the first to realize that it hasn't ended yet.In the first moments of this movie we see the past and discover that it wasn't the first time Elise had a meeting with Josh. As a child she was there to help as well. Under hypnosis she finds out what she needs to know about the haunting and thinks that using the hypnosis she can erase the knowledge of the Further from Josh's mind forever. Alas this isn't the case.As things begin to happen in Josh's mother Lorraine's (Barbara Hershey) house, Renai is frightened once more for her family. But this time she also has a fear of Josh as well. While he may have rescued their son and brought him back from the dark place he went to, he seems somehow different. The police suspecting him of being the one that killed Elise doesn't ease her mind any.As Lorraine begins to see ghostly figures in her home she and Renai begin to attack the problem from different angles, neither knowing at first what the other is doing. Lorraine approaches Carl, Elise's assistant from year's back who brought her into the case. Renai on the other hand approaches Elise's assistants Specs and Tucker. Eventually their pursuits cross paths and the trio teams up to help this family.I won't give away the details of the reveal here but the fact is they give it away early on, as a matter of fact with Renai's fear that Josh isn't the man he was. Suffice to say that the bride in black from the first film hasn't gone off to her just desserts yet. As a matter of fact just who the bride is is revealed more here than in the first film. The jump scares aren't as many here but the depth of story is more fleshed out and when it is revealed it's a much creepier concept than originally brought out.The actors do a wonderful job here with not one taking center stage. That's a tough job when there are 2 to 3 name actors who normally would dominate the film. Instead this feels more like an ensemble piece where each has a role to play in the telling of this story. The stand out character in this film is more the lighting and camera work on display. Both flesh out the tale more than the words and acting. This isn't denigrating the actor's performances, just noting that everything from start to finish is enhanced by the use of light and shadow.It may seem odd for this to be the top release coming out the week of Christmas to DVD but horror films seem to be more widespread these days than ever before. The good news is that this one seems to fulfill every need that horror and suspense fans will love. That means that not only is this one worth watching but one to add to the collection as well.

But mine is not a universal opinion, as it&#65533;s easy to see from scrolling through these reviews. It&#65533;s a movie that kind of defies categorization: it&#65533;s not really a romance, it&#65533;s sure not an action thriller or a mystery or sci-fi or fantasy or horror. So what is it?I think Lost in Translation is a visual essay on the modern condition: disconnection from self, others, and ones surroundings. Here&#65533;s the setup: Bill Murray plays American middle-aged actor Bob Harris (a generic name, if ever there was one, prob standing in for Everyman), in Tokyo to film a commercial for Santori whiskey. He&#65533;s bored, horribly jetlagged, at sea with Japanese language and the accented attempts of the Japanese to speak English to him, lonely, and disaffected. And here&#65533;s one thing: I&#65533;ve never before seen a movie with Bill Murray in it that I liked to any degree whatsoever; all schlock. But he&#65533;s been underrated, I see now: he&#65533;s absolutely superb in Lost in Translation.Our man Bob keeps encountering another American (Scarlett Johansson, of Girl with the Pearl Earring fame), equally out of synch with the time zones, more or less abandoned by her photographer husband, and already, in her young life, feeling colossally alone.They strike up a relationship of sorts, and in spite of their obvious age difference, become soul mates forever &#65533; and there&#65533;s no sex.Amazingly done.

Drawn and animated in Genndy Tartakovsky's brilliantly stark geometric style quite similar to that of The Powerpuff Girls, the story opens as Dexter is suddenly attacked by a whole band of Transformer-like robots from the distant future. Our brooding young hero then finds himself being whisked off on the most amazing adventure of his whole lifetime: he meets himself at three different ages and learns the whole story behind it as he goes from one chilling scenario to another. His archrival, the nerdy Mandark had taken over the whole world through his very own genius and thus brought about its ruin while poor Dexter himself had fallen from his own glory to eventually escape Mandark's greedy clutches and build himself up as a muscle-bound, middle-aged crusader behind eyeless goggles. So young Dexter himself is there to help him out! And as the saying goes, the rest is history. VERY IMPRESSIVE!!! The very artful opening credits themselves are just simply marvelous as well as the cleverly designed fantastic settings created for Dexter's latest exploits!

Without really strong director in this improv-style, actors tend to make every scene filled with crisis to make their roles more ""interesting""for themselves, and their events more dramatic.  This film has a stronger script than others of this type, more shape, but still that feeling.  Too much  a rabbit warren of hystrionics.The strongest performance is that of nordicly handsome Ulrich Thomson as Christian, a man coming home to a huge family reunion/birthday party to confront his famous patriarch about childhood incest.  The family history unfolds mainly around the dinner table in ""toastmaster"" style speaches.  This is all set up well.  Thomson, having the most devasting role, gives the most understated performance, and we are drawn to his detatchment.The truthfullness of the movie is that everyone is so anxious to punish the victim for speaking out... and the history that unfolds of the treatment the victim has repeatedly received, again, for having been a victim.  It is the great kernal of the story here that makes this movie rise above its style and plot elements.A big problem is the huge cast of people who seem completely unconnected at the dinner party.  They seem to have no feelings for the situation, the individuals, and that is a script and a directoral problem.  The cast could have been cut in half, it still would have been large enough to give a sense of society, but it would have worked better.  I also felt there were casting problems throughout, the mother gives a wonderful patrician performance, but she does not look like any of the children in any way.The overall problem is that the writer seems to be young, demanding very adolescent behavior from almost every character, which gets wearing and makes everyone a bit less interesting.All that said, I agree that this is a director who will be interesting to watch, and so much of this is very skillfully done, it is akin to watching a really marvelous class project - tremendous potential, as the director was clearly setting challenges for himself even beyond the restrictions of the festival.Being a Danish film, only the art house crowd in other countries is likely to see this, and if you are one of those folks - as I am - it is interesting to watch, and well done.",4.0,0.3333333333333333,3,1,0.4019,positive,0.9711,very positive,2006,2,7

Eban is ostensibly taking his Christmas vacation from his job in Seattle coaching (junior?) high school soccer.  In fact the school had fired him quietly for an inappropriate relationship with a student.  Curiously, the school chose to tell Eban's father (played by Ron Upton), who keeps it to himself for a while.  Eban hangs on to a photo of the student and glances longingly at it from time to time.  Eban does have to remake himself.Riding a bike around town, Eban stops at a CD store where soon-to-be fifteen-year old Charley (played by Giovanni Andrade) is shopping with his deaf-mute friend, Kevin (played by Drew Zeller).  Eban strikes up several conversations with Charley.  They share an interest in guitar playing, drawing, and poetry.  Charley's mother died recently, and his father (played by Nolan V. Chard) is actively dating and seems unsupportive to Charley.  Eban and Charley become friends.  At this point the audience can suspect Eban being a classic ephebephile.Then the dynamic changes.  Charley emerges as the more driven character, the one with the vision.  Eban settles back into a passive role, like the more classic female romance character who first hooks her man and later lets him feel in command.  Charley drives the action forward.  In their tasteful make-out scene, Charley is on top, kissing and groping Eban, who just lies there.A parallel story shows Charley's girl friend Sunshine (played by Ellie Nicholson), who claims people have only one chance at happiness.  She is going to take hers by running away with Kevin.  Charley is very interested in the details.  Are there an ultimate purpose, a destination, economic support, and safety from pursuit?  Charley even gives her some money from the cache his mother left behind to him and which his father wants for bill payments.When Eban and Charley's fathers start actively disapproving, some decisions need making.Should Eban and Charley stop seeing each other?If Eban moved home for good, how would they circumvent family and other resistance?If Charley moved to Seattle, how would Eban support him?  Would Charley have to contribute?  What about Charley's schooling?  What about Eban's former love interest?  What about a future Eban love interest?  What if an official from Eban's former school sees Eban and Charley together?  How many hours would it take for Charley's father to get Eban arrested?If they moved abroad, where to?  What about passports and visas?  What about money?At this point someone has to be the adult.  Charley  presents a vision but now delegates it to Eban to figure out the mechanics.  Big John of ""L.I.E."" could sort it out.  Is Eban up to it?The acting is good, suiting the characters and their ages.  The script is straightforward.  The romance feels dreamy and poetic, while the camera keeps a sharper focus.The movie ends with a hopeful feeling, but isn't it a fool's paradise?",4.0,0.7777777777777778,2,1,-0.4939,negative,0.992,very positive,2002,8,29

Based on true events, the movie stars Ingrid Bergman as Gladys Aylward, a parlour-maid in England who wants to become a Chinese missionary.  Leaving her job in Liverpool, Gladys travels to London and the mission society, only to be told she's simply not qualified for life overseas.  While the society finds her a new position in London, Gladys still clings to her dream of going to China, and saves her money to buy a passage on the Trans-Siberian railway.Finally in China's province of Wang-Cheng, Gladys joins up with missionary Mrs Lawson (Athene Seyler) and together they open an inn for traveling muleteers, called The Inn of the Sixth Happiness, where people can get a hot meal, a place to sleep, and hear stories from the Bible.  When Gladys queries her on the sixth happiness, Mrs Lawson replies ""Each person decides in his own heart what the sixth happiness is"".  While Gladys is initially unwelcomed by the villagers, she's soon taken in and loved by everybody, including the Mandarin (Robert Donat in his final role); as well as the handsome Eurasian, Captain Lin Nan (Curd Jurgens).Life in Wang-Cheng continues it's natural path for Gladys and the other villagers, until Japanese forces threaten to invade, and the lives of innocent people are endangered.  The Mandarin orders the entire village to flee for the hills, and in a tearful sequence, he says farewell to his 'Jenai'.  But Gladys' most important mission is yet to come.  She must lead 100 children over the mountains to the safety of a Christian missionary school.Based on ""The Small Woman"" by Alan Burgess, THE INN OF THE SIXTH HAPPINESS was a very successful movie, but it did change a lot of historical truths in favour of Hollywood fantasy.  The real Gladys Aylward was appalled at the alleged romance between her character and Captain Nan; but of course the film works better if we know that Gladys is a complete woman with romantic inclinations (Bergman and Jurgens have good chemistry too).  The location filming was done throughout North Wales and London (and the locations do create a convincing sense of being in China).Robert Donat died before the movie was released.  He's so wonderful as the Mandarin, you just want to get up and hug him in that final scene!  Curd Jurgens is equally fine as Lin.  Ingrid Bergman brings all her best qualities and strengths to the role of Gladys; this is one of her best performances.  Despite her work, Bergman was not nominated for an Academy Award, probably because of her recent win for ""Anastasia"".  The film was directed by Mark Robson, following his work in ""Peyton Place"" the previous year.  He acquits himself nicely here; and while the scenes often border on epic, in essence it is a small story about one ""small woman"".You'll adore this inspirational and heart-warming movie masterpiece.",4.0,1.0,5,1,0.0,neutral,0.999,very positive,2007,4,20

These range from the mildly interesting to the inane, to clumsy attempts at social commentary via the actions of those involved.In a plot device similar but inferior toGRAND HOTEL(1932), a constant shuffle of scenarios has us meeting and spending time with:*An aging, alcoholic nightclub/Vegas entertainer (Demi Moore) and her long-suffering husband/manager (Emilio Estevez, this film's writer/director).*A young lady (Lindsay Lohan) who at 9 pm is marrying a guy she barely knows (Elijah Wood), just to keep him from being shipped to Vietnam.*Married socialite/campaign donors (Martin Sheen and Helen Hunt) who must at the last minute shop for black shoes when she forgets to pack a pair.*The Ambassador's kitchen chief (Christian Slater), a bigot abusive to the Mexican immigrants he supervises.*The hotel's general manager (William H. Macy), who fires the racist after he witnesses his hatred in action, also this man's wife (Sharon Stone, an on-site beautician, and his mistress (Heather Graham), an Ambassador switchboard operator.*A dedicated African-American campaign staffer (Nick Cannon), who hopes his meeting with RFK will turn into a permanent job, and his girlfriend (Joy Bryant), another switchboard operator.*Two Mexican-American busboys (Freddy Rodriguez and Jacob Vargas) and a philosophic sous chef (Laurence Fishburne) who likes one but not the other.*An elderly former doorman (Anthony Hopkins) with nothing to do since his wife's death. He plays chess in the Ambassador's lobby with an equally old pal (Harry Belafonte) for hours on end.*A reporter for a Czechoslovak newspaper (Svetlana Metkina) who's been waiting days for an interview with Sen. Kennedy.*A couple of goofball campaign workers (Brian Geraghty and Shia LaBeouf) that play hookey this primary day to drop acid for the first time with a spaced-out hippie acquaintance (Ashton Kutcher). (These segments are the film's moments of comic relief.)So we sit through many stories, impatiently waiting for Bobby (Dave Fraunces) to encounter Sirhan Sirhan (David Kobzantsev), and honestly, some of this stuff is deadly dull, but after those multiple shots ring out, most of what seemed divergent storylines tie together amidst absolute mass hysteria in ways we never saw coming.

The opening scenes are charming showing an American businessman traveling through India to his new assignment and his encounters with colorful local people.One scene which typifies the film illustrates his travels on a crowded Indian train where a small boy offers him his seat. Then, as if it were the most natural thing, the boy climbs into his lap and resumes his fidgeting.

Gregory Peck plays Keith Mallory, the team leader, chosen because he speaks ""Greek like a Greek and German like a German"" and was reputed to be ""the greatest mountain-climber in the world before the war."" That last skill comes in mighty handy, because an early part of the mission involves scaling a very high sheer cliff, which occurs just after the team survives a nasty storm at sea and a perilous - and very realistic-looking - landing on a rocky coast. The other specialists include a cynical demolitions expert (David Niven), a guerrilla fighter nursing a grudge against Mallory (Anthony Quinn), a burned-out expert killer (Stanley Baker), a young but skilled assassin (teen idol James Darren - who even gets to sing), and a pair of female Greek freedom fighters (Irene Papas and Gia Scala). ""With every one of us a genius, how can we fail?"" Mallory asks. ""You can't,"" his superior replies, and therein starts the tale, punctuated by titles such as ""The first day. 07.00 hours."" The device is a bit heavy-handed, as are many other moments, but it's really best to ignore such indulgences and instead just enjoy this as a popcorn thriller, 1960s style, with its Oscar-winning special effects, Greek locales, and a peppy, basso-profundo score by Dimitri Tiompkin.Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)",4.0,0.0,1,2,0.6962,very positive,0.9731,very positive,2013,9,11
1067359,B000OYCMLM,A2PTPOUABGG8K2,1,1,2012-07-14,"This films greatest trick, is convincing you it's shown you all its tricks.","Wow, what a refreshing film in what has become a stale genre as of late. Along with ""Cabin in the Woods"" this is one of the few new horror films which I thought was genuine and smart. I hesitate to call it a spoof because while it does mention other horror franchise and take light humorous jabs at cliches of the genre, it really attempts to stand on its own, with it's own unique story.The film is set in a small town where a young man named Leslie (last name in question.) who has chosen the career of a haunting serial killer, to in his mind, balance out the eternal good of the war, which needs an inherent evil to fight. You would think a man of this mind frame would come across as disturbed, unsettled and probably unpleasant to converse with, yet this is quite the opposite. Leslie is a kind, polite and hilarious individual and while he might have trouble feeding his pet turtles he seems like a genuinely nice guy......Well as genuine and nice a person can be while stalking in the shadows and planning to kill over half a dozen teenagers. Along on his life journey of disemboweling sexually active teens smoking weed, he picks up three grad students who make a documentary about him and through the first hour of this film we see the other side of the horror genre. Instead of seeing the killer among the fog and darkness of the wilderness, hunting his prey, this film shows him in the days, hours and minutes leading up to that point. Giddily plotting his ""art"" and setting up some demented ""Home Alone"" type traps. This completely flips the script on the horror genre and it is executed well, it avoids cliches by facing them head on with a smirk.Yet Leslie isn't fully happy until he finds his ""Ahab"" an eternal figure of good (also his therapist) whom he can duke it out in the finale of Good Vs. Evil. This character is ironically played by Fred Krueger himself, Robert Englund in a character that should remind any horror fan of Dr. Loomis from the Halloween franchise. So along with the help of a dear friend (a retired serial killer who seems to miss picking up the ole' axe and going on a spree or two) Leslie seems well off on his mission and extremely joyous about it. However, the film flips its switch as soon as it lets the light in and plays out well in the third act. In conclusion this is a well acted film for fans of the genre and general movie goers alike. As a horror film released post early 90's this is easily a five star within the genre, buy without hesitation.",4.0,1.0,1,2,0.7351,very positive,-0.9638,very negative,2012,7,14

A young Naoko Mori has a supporting act.The main characters are Edina Monsoon, her friend Patsy and Edina's daughter Saffron. Edina is a 40-something defrocked hippie, living a bohemian and completely meaningless life of drugs, New Age fads, fashion advertising and rank debauchery. Apparently, she still insists on voting Labour. Her friend Patsy is something of a leech, who probably never had a real job in her entire life. She's supposedly 47 but looks twice as old, despite plastic surgery. Saffron is the prudish, grey and boring teenage daughter of Eddie. Throughout the series, she is constantly harassed by both Edina and Patsy.I honestly admit that I don't understand what's so funny about this series. Most of the jokes are incomprehensible. Do I socialize in the wrong circles? Is that why I don't get it? But then, you probably have to be insane to socialize with people like Eddie, Patsy and Saffy, LOL.Despite not getting it (really), I nevertheless laughed myself through every episode. I'm not sure why. Maybe I *do* get it, at some subliminal level. Or maybe I laugh simply because the whole series is absolutely insane. I mean, what should we make of Edina's secretary Bubble? She's arguably the goofiest character ever invented on the movie screen. Or what about Jackie, Patsy's older sister who smoked opium with Che Guevara and Mao, and now wants to start a home for abandoned cats? Supposedly, Jacques Brel wrote his song ""Jackie"" in her honour (yeah, right). In one episode, Edina decides to start an advertising campaign in the projects using gigantic billboards saying: ""CHEER UP, IT MIGHT NEVER HAPPEN"". (I'm not sure whether this episode is included on this DVD, however. Check out some fan site.)The funniest character of the show is, of course, poor grey Saffy, who looks and behaves as a spinster despite being only a teenager. The contrast between her and her hippie mother Eddie couldn't be greater. Saffy's friend Sarah is even worse. We're talking Salvation Army material. The constant brawls between Saffron and Edina, where Saffy is forced to act ""mother"" to the irresponsible Eddie, are the centrepiece of the show.And yet, I still don't quite get it...I'm not sure how the rate this show and its weird gallery of crackpots, but for old times sake, I'll give it four out of five.",4.0,0.0,1,1,0.0,neutral,0.7523,very positive,2010,3,2

Mr. Meyers does not appear in this film and that comes as a welcome relief.

Anyhow, Halloween 3 is the story of a sinister mask maker (played by Dan O'Herlihy) who develops a diabolical plot to kill America's children with his Silver Shamrock Halloween masks.  It's a pretty good story that, in some ways might remind you of the original &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers.&quot;  It's also a social commentary on the brainwashing that occurs in certain children's advertising.

Being that this only contains one disc, with only 5 episodes, it is hard to fully judge the series.No spoilers from me, but the storyline is set in the near future, the Hell's Gate has opened and all of the stars in the sky have been replaced by fake stars that are representations of ""Contractors"". The episodes on the disc somewhat slowly bring us up to speed on the back story of how beings with special abilities, like ""Contractors"" (remorseless assassins with special powers that come with a price), ""Dolls"" (basically blank humans who can be implanted with temporary memories/personalities or who can perform specific functions like remote sensing and observation), and some hybrids thrown into the mix as well.There are several groups of players interacting, including a special police unit that tracks ""Contractors"", The Syndicate (including the main ""Contractor"" Hei/Bk201), various governments (references to French, Americans, and British spy agencies), and other criminal groups (all employing ""Contractors"").As the storyline unfolds it becomes apparent that not all ""Contractors"" follow the stereotype and in the cliffhanger final episode, we learn something about Hei's motivation (again, no spoilers). It was enough of a hook that I will likely buy the next volume:Darker Than Black, Vol. 2The animation was passable overall. It has some truly beautiful artwork in some scenes and some of the flattest animation in others.

163758,0800135954,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,3,5,2006-07-22,Deliberately a Beautiful Epic - but Stereotypes Abound,"Legends of the Fall is an epic family-based story set in a gorgeous landscape - the untamed lands of Montana in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Like most of these sweeping stories, it is about beautiful people and torrential passion. You don't watch these for a lot of sensical plotline and in depth dialogue. You watch for the soap-opera highs, lows and beautiful faces.Brad Pitt and his long hair are the key here. He is the oldest son - the most beloved son - out of three. He is pretty much raised by an ""Indian Chief"" who is a good friend of father Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins had been a soldier in the Indian Wars, had been sickened by what happened, and retreated to Montana to raise his family. Rounding out the family is a servant couple - a native american woman, her American husband, and their half-breed daughter.There are interesting commentaries on the Indian situation here. A pub owner refuses to serve to the chief because of his race. The servants won't send their daughter to the local school because they're worried she'd be picked on. On the other hand, the Chief is portrayed as an ""all wise"" character - one who trains Pitt to kill everything in sight and to scalp people. It made me a bit uncomfortable.But again, this isn't a movie about gripping accuracy. It's about epicness. There are thundering, rich musical interludes, and truly stunning scenery. The actors NEVER seem to age throughout the entire story. They are always young and beautiful.Women aren't treated very well by this film. There's the mom who takes off on her family without any regret. There's the ""half breed"" who is only 20 when Pitt takes her for his wife, in a move bordering on incest given how they grew up together. That's how these stories go, of course. You've got the abandoning cold one, the innocent sweet killed-too-soon one - and then of course the third ""stereotype"" - the passionate woman that everybody wants.That would be Julia Ormand. Julia falls for the youngest son first - played by Henry Thomas. When she shows up in Montana with him, the other 2 sons fall for her as well. She is lured by Pitt's manliness but dutifully restrains herself. In no time at all Thomas is running off to join in WWI, and his 2 brothers go along to protect him. Julie pleads with Pitt to protect her fiance. Unfortunately, Thomas dies rather quickly, and Pitt feels like it is his fault.So now you begin the real epicosity of the story. Aidan Quinn - the middle son - reveals his love for widow Julia. She rebuffs him, pining for Pitt. Pitt makes love to Julia and Quinn is jealous. Quinn takes off, Pitt hangs out for a while - long enough for Julia to become completely in love with him - then takes off for years and years. Julia pines and cries. Finally Julia gives in to Quinn rather than be alone. Then of course this is Pitt's cue to return and to take up with the now-barely-20 almost-a-sister. In a short period of time the new wife is killed because of Pitt's rum-running, Julia commits suicide rather than be away from him, and the remaining family (all men except the lone Indian woman) settles down again.I really love the beautiful landscapes, the beautiful actors - but I guess I just like ""realism"" too much to have fully appreciated the epic-cicity of this. Julia cries and cries and cries. She starts out as an intelligent, athletic woman who can handle horses - but ends up petulant and weak. No other female in the cast even has a chance. Quinn is great as the middle son who does his extreme best and is never respected for it, or given love. Thomas doesn't have much to work with in being the ""sweet innocent protected idealistic youngest son"" who is killed off in short order.Then there's Pitt. His main job is to look handsome and manly. He breaks wild horses. He wrangles the herd. He watches out for his younger brother. He fights with a bear. The women all adore him. He breaks down and sobs at his brother's death. This melts the heart of all female watchers :). A cowboy who can handle the rough mustangs! The soldier who can shoot straight! The man who can cry when he's sad! Plus the looks! He's set out to be a God.The ironic part is that Pitt mistreats the women he comes across - and yet because of the above qualities it's considered ""OK"" - just as when soap opera guys mistreat their women it's excused because ""well men will be men"". He hates his mom for leaving them even while his brothers accept it. He is fond of Julia - but once he has her firmly in love with him, he abandons her because he wants to be wild and free. He refuses to write to her, and when he finally does he is callous. When he comes back, he quickly climbs into the arms of the servant girl who has been pretty much a sister to him his whole life - something to me akin to a teacher agreeing to a student's embraces. He deliberately engages in risky gun-running which endangers his family, and she dies as a result. His treatment of Julia drives her to suicide. And yet somehow he emerges as the hero of the story.So while I really appreciated where this story was going, and that it was meant to be full of epicness, I didn't like much at all how it treated women - or native Americans. Both were used as extreme stereotypes. The gorgeous landscapes and gorgeous actors could have created an amazingly meaningful story - but what we got didn't quite measure up to that potential.",4.0,0.6,2,2,0.3506,positive,0.9982,very positive,2006,7,22

LOW tries to be balanced and not too preachy; the rationalizations actually make some sense. The film downplays the political connections more than is likely true, though, I'd guess (destabilization of third world countries is one of the CIA's favorite tactics, as revealed by many ex-agents in many books, as is the Agency's drug-dealing as a method of both ""insurgent"" funding and arms trading, as revealed in the Iran/Contra hearings).My main qualm is with Cage, who somehow always seems to invest his characters with less brains and savvy than they deserve. It worked great in Raising Arizona but is wearing thin since then. He's kind of like the unthinking man's James Caan. Cage comes so close sometimes, but I just can't buy him all the way. Here he is solid but never transcends and takes this movie to the next level.Leto is good, as are most of the bit players, especially some of the Africans, who have more presence than some of the stars.LOW does get pretty violent.

728117,B00007G1WM,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,1,1,2010-09-23,Good Film. Wrong Genre.,"""The Last Vampyre"" was one of five feature-length films made for Granada Television's decade-long Sherlock Holmes series (1984-1994) in which Jeremy Brett starred as the brilliant Victorian detective. The writing in the series' final years was not as good as in its prime, nor of exactly the same character. It tended to be more lurid and looser with Holmes' demeanor. ""The Last Vampyre"" exhibits many of the pitfalls of those last seasons, and is generally poorly-regarded by fans of the series. Taken within the context of the series, I can see why this would be the case. That was my reaction the first time I saw it -and to ""The Master Blackmailer"", the previous year's sub-par entry. But, when I see the film again, 17 years later, its strengths as a stand-alone film are equally evident to its poor fit within the Holmes cinematic canon.Sherlock Holmes (Jeremy Brett) and Dr. Watson (Edward Hardwicke) are visited in Baker Street by the Reverend Merridew (Maurice Denham) of Lamberley. Merridew is alarmed by mysterious deaths in his village and the townspeople's tendency to cast blame on a newcomer, Mr. John Stockton (Roy Marden), whom the local peasants believe to be a vampire. Holmes visits the village, where he finds ""a dangerous mood in the air"". The Ferguson family, whose infant son died suddenly after a dinner with Mr. Stockton, is especially distraught. Mr. Ferguson (Keith Barron) is a cotton grower who brought his new Peruvian wife Carlotta (Yolanda Vasquey), his teenaged son Jack (Richard Dempsey), and the baby to live in England. That brought only tragedy, and now Mr. Ferguson fears he is losing his moody son and grieving wife to Stockton's sinister influence.""The Last Vampyre"" was expanded from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short story ""The Sussex Vampire"". A straight adaptation of the story might have fared better. Nevertheless, the addition of Stockton, a scholar of South American religious cults come to Lamberley seeking his family roots, keeps the audience guessing as to his motives and places an additional stress on the Ferguson family. Ultimately, this is the story of a troubled family, and Holmes' deductions are more psychological than detective work. He discovers what any perceptive outsider would see quickly but which the hysterical townspeople and beleaguered Mr. Ferguson are blind to. ""The Last Vampyre"" is more psychological thriller than detective story, and, as such, is an oddball in the Holmes series. But, considered as a psychological thriller with an injection of Victorian shilling-shocker, it makes sense.",4.0,1.0,10,1,-0.0516,neutral,-0.9942,very negative,2010,9,23

Outside of few smudgy areas that look like Vaseline was smeared on the screen (check the scene where Lady chases the rat out of the yard, for a good example), the movie looks like it could have been completed yesterday! The lines are crisp. The colors are vibrant. And the wider aspect-ratio lets us see things no one -- outside of those at Disney -- have ever been able to see prior to this release. So, with the blu, you get a dazzling picture and more of that dazzling picture to love! On the audio side, things are a little weaker. There is a noticeable ""tape hiss"" throughout most of the movie. It's at its worst during dialogue scenes with gaps and no music to fill them. But it is there throughout (although my girlfriend didn't even notice until I pointed it out, so apparently I'm super-sensitive toward this sort of sound). I'm sure the hiss is due to the age of the film, but it's worth noting, nonetheless.The movie itself? If you're here reading this review -- you already know.

It was so much fun to watch him laugh and cheer at all the same places I did 25 years earlier. Lady and the Tramp is a winner and the blu-ray transfer more than does it justice. To sum it all up?

496294,B00000F0EE,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,10,11,2006-06-13,An inspiring but less than accurate look at Carlson's Raiders,"I love a good war movie, but there's something extra special about a war movie filmed while the fight is ongoing - especially when it recounts the story of a major victory that has been largely forgotten by history.  America's initial offensive thrust into Japanese-occupied territory took place at Makin Island (Butaritari atoll), and Gung Ho! is the story of that mission as carried out by the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion (Carlson's Raiders).  The strategic importance of the mission is now a matter of some debate, but at the time it was seen as an important diversion intended to disrupt Japanese communications and draw some of their forces away from more important targets (particularly Guadalcanal and Tulagi).  There was no attempt to actually occupy the island - this was a quick, decisive raid designed to take out every Japanese installation (especially the radio tower) and kill every Japanese soldier on the island - get in quick, get out quick, and leave nothing but destruction behind you.The Makin Island operation provided an important boost to morale back home, and this film obviously was made to further bolster domestic support for the war.  As a propaganda film (and I must say I hate calling any film that passionately espouses the causes of liberty and freedom propaganda), it's a real winner: we lost some boys on that island, but the mission was a complete success, and the patriotic speech at the very end puts a great big morale-boosting bow on the whole package.  As history, the film doesn't hold much water.  Not to take away from the bravery of Carlson's Raiders (which included FDR's son), but the whole mission was basically a mess.  Just about everything that could go wrong did go wrong - but you won't hear any of this in the film: more elaborate plans had to be altered due to choppy seas and heavy rains (one boat never got the new orders); the landing was chaotic to say the least; overestimating the size of the Japanese forces on the island, Carlson chose to withdraw that evening but could not get his men back to the subs due to the inclement weather, which in turn led him to actually surrender during the night - until, that is, he finally learned that his men had all but wiped out Japanese resistance already; and nine men were unknowingly left behind (and eventually beheaded by the Japanese).  Some of his men later questioned his leadership abilities.Obviously, the true story of Carlson's Raiders would not make for a good movie, especially during war-time.  As a morale booster and as entertainment, however, Gung Ho! is highly successful.  It follows the volunteer recruits who made the cut all the way from their rigorous, unorthodox training to their overseas journey tucked inside two submarines (this was the only landing via submarine during the entire war) - pausing to take in the remains of the attack on Pearl Harbor on the way - to their landing and fierce combat on Makin Island.  The acting is quite good from top to bottom and includes such well-known actors as Randolph Scott, Noah Beery, Jr., and a young Robert Mitchum (who is one fellow I would certainly want in my army).  I was a little disappointed in the actual combat scenes, though - after hearing about all of this unconventional training for the mission (Carlson taught his men how to fight dirty, knowing full well that the Japanese would fight dirty at every turn), the actual fighting turned out to be fairly conventional for the most part (but the hand-to-hand combat does portray the viciousness of the fighting pretty effectively).Gung Ho! is a notable wartime film from 1943, but it turns out that the true story of Carlson's Raiders and Carlson himself is much more interesting than Hollywood's version of the August 1942 raid on Makin Island.  Carlson is a fascinating man, having fought in several foreign armies (including a stint with the Chinese Communist Army) before America entered World War II.  His Gung Ho! battle cry reflected his training philosophy of ethical indoctrination; to him, every soldier was equal and was to be treated as an equal, for only then could the necessary sense of community make his men the most effective fighting force possible.  He was quite a maverick in the military, in both tactics (drawing heavily upon Mao-ist guerilla warfare) and political philosophy (insofar as he leaned noticeably toward Communism).",4.0,0.9090909090909092,6,1,0.2263,positive,-0.6566,very negative,2006,6,13

And if it doesn't quite measureup to the best 'grown up' TV of today, it still deserves praise for being one of the series that brokethe mold of what a TV show was supposed to be.It had an openness to complicated tones that seamlessly mixed wild, sometimes surreal humor,more subtle humor and drama, to long story arcs and not easily solved once a week problems,and to being more about character than event, making TV a more novelistic and sometimescinematic medium in the process.Certainly Ally McBeal wasn't the first show to do any of these things, but it was one of the firstshows that was a big success with these new approaches, and that helped paved the way formany of the best dramas dramadies and comedies on TV in the years since.I'll admit, with years of even braver shows since, Ally McBeal no longer feels quite as special, andin fact now feels a little limited.  Especially with DVDs allowing more than once a week viewing,a certain sameness to Ally's constantly fearful, broken heart and her funny/sad attempts to overcomeit starts to plague the show.But there's still a lot to enjoy here.  The performances are terrific from top to bottom, and every'silly' character is given their serious and moving moments, and every 'serious' character is allowedto be laugh-out-loud funny at times.  Special mention has to be made of Peter MacNichol's 'The Biscuit',one of the oddest, funniest characters to actually work brilliantly in any series.The writing is sharp and full of wit and pathos.  The music is integrated in a way that was rare forTV before, but much imitated since, with montages to songs played and sung by Vonda Shepard(a great voice) who often also appears in the series as a singer at the lead characters favorite afterhours watering hole.I do have to say, some of the music now feels, in retrospect, too on the nose.  The songs chosen (or written) almostalways have lyrics that are too spot on, too obvious a commentary on the action,  That good and badside to the music sort of sums up my perspective on the series looking at it again in 2011.

He again directs Brad Pitt (previously in Fincher'sSeven), this time as a man inexplicably born with all the physical characteristics of an 80 year old who then ages in reverse. All this while his mental faculties work in standard time, so he gains an old man's lifetime of memories. While Fincher usually pulls at the strings that manipulate us into staring at the darkness of man (thinkZodiac), this time he goes right for melodramatic heartstrings.It's not always a perfect fit. While Fincher has, as usual, made a gorgeously rich looking movie, there are times when you wonder why Benjamin was just free to wander aimlessly through life, not having scientists and doctors swarming around him. And while the story of the clock at the beginning of the movie is a poignant allegory and therefore seemed useful to the film, the element of Hurricane Katrina as a timing device seemed crowbarred in. Will that stop you from needing at least one box of Kleenex to make it through this movie? Not at all.""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is a moving story of how aging takes us through life, both in love and in tragedy. ""We all end up in diapers,"" says Daisy (Cate Blanchett, amazing as always) who tries to make sense of her love with a man that can only drift away. The cast is uniformly strong throughout, with Taraji P. Henson as Queenie getting the best 'wisdom' lines, a scene stealing Tilda Swinton as Benjamin's first love affair and Jared Harris as Capt Mike, the swashbuckling tugboat man with the heart of an artist. The overall tragedy is speckled with bits of humor and lots of deep love.In the end, though, the movie belongs to Brad Pitt. Through make-up, CGI and other devices, he portrays Benjamin as man out of time, trying to comprehend the way life has changed the world as he moves in reverse of everyone around him. Even though he is absent from the last 30 minutes, his presence is felt in the way Daisy takes him back to where everything began.

690808,B00005YUP1,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,5,6,2005-09-03,"""I didn't even know why I was being sent to the camps!""","Paragraph 175 is a powerful documentary that deals with a provocative subject. I just wish filmmakers Jeffrey Friedman and Rob Epstein had fleshed out the subject a bit more. While this film about gay men who were persecuted and imprisoned under the Nazi regime, is in many respects absorbing, the film ultimately suffers from an overly narrow and constricted focus.Perhaps the problem was that there were just not enough men alive today who were willing to talk about their experiences. From the outset, the pool of interviewees was certainly going to be limited, but also limited is the actual archival footage of life in the concentration camps.Instead the directors have chosen to pepper the film with well-preserved family photographs, and lively footage of gay and lesbian culture blossoming during the days of the Weimar Republic after WW1. Sensitively narrated by British actor Rupert Everett, Paragraph 175 is all about the German penal code, which was originally enacted in 1871, and later used by the Nazis, to outlaw homosexuality.The penal code stated: ""An unnatural sex act committed between persons of male sex is punishable by imprisonment; the loss of civil rights may also be imposed,"" But Paragraph 175 was never really enforced until the Nazi's came to power. This documentary centers on six emotional accounts of the most elderly and frail survivors of the concentration camps who, up until now, have repressed their stories.There's a Jewish gay resistance fighter who posed as a Hitler Youth member to rescue his lover from a Gestapo transfer camp in an ultimately futile effort; a photographer who was arrested and imprisoned for homosexuality, who upon his release joined the army because of the lack of men in his hometown and he ""wanted to be with men.""There's a young man who was freed from a sentence at Dachau only to be interned again at Buchenwald, and a Frenchman imprisoned from Alsace, who breaks down after telling of being raped and subject to inhuman torture. Their stories are indeed heart wrenching, because unlike the Jews, they have forced to live quietly, unable to share their horrific experiences for so long.It is interesting to note that the penal code didn't cover lesbians. The Nazis considered lesbians to be  ""curable."" Women were regarded, as vessels of motherhood - increasing the German population was top priority - therefore, they were exempt from mass arrest. Most lesbians went into exile or quietly married gay men. One woman, who tells her story in the film, was given exit papers and was lucky enough to escape to England.The statistics are staggering: Between 1933 and 1945, some 100,000 men were arrested for homosexuality, roughly half of them were sentenced to prison, and from 10,000 to 15,000 were sent to concentration camps. The camps were used for re-education, slave labor, castration and sadistic medical experiments. It's believed only about 4,000 survived their ordeal.The situation didn't improve after the war. Paragraph 175 remained in force until the late sixties, so many gay men were re-imprisoned and subject to repeated persecution. In this respect, Epstein and Friedman should be largely commended for bringing this subject to the attention of the world, and telling these powerful personal stories before the last survivors die.

Somehow they capture the essence of what I imagine it is to be Japanese and to live in Japan. It's refreshing to see a cultural output that draws on its own folklore that is so alien to what most of us, who have grown up on the Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Anderson, and Pixar, know and cherish. In Pom Poko, we have a good example of this.Pom Poko is about a group of Tanuki, raccoon-dogs, who live in the forests on the edges of Tokyo in the 1960s. As Tokyo expands, the Tanuki are forced to take action at the loss of their habitat. The journey on how they first fight against their habitat to ultimately learn to live with their human neighbors is a poignant and sad one. A host of questions are raised and there are no easy answers. Still, the movie sparkles with wit and humor. Lots of humor, especially from the lines that the narrator speaks. And yes there are balls. So what? It's just another slice of Japan; one that I find interesting if bewildering.Should you watch this? If you love Studio Ghibli, then yes. If you love a good story, then yes as well. The theme of the story is something not unique to Japan either. Learning to live in balance with our surroundings is something all modern societies struggle with.

Some very good, some not so much, but the ""standard"" of story telling was pretty consistent.

I wish more shows would develop a full story arc and then populate the episodes to move through the arc, again, like B5. All stories have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Regardless of the ""hit"" status of a show, better to stop it on top, when the story is done than keep it going (Stargate ended...but then didn't).I guess I liked the season overall.

619922,B00005JMJD,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,2,2,2009-08-31,A growing moody storm of a life,"The film Sylvia deals with the second half of poet Sylvia Plath's life, primarily on her marriage and motherhood and final great creative efforts. It is a tragic tale. It is tragic for within the wonderful creative person is growing depression, anxiety, and suspicion.  The film reminds us that the human condition is fragile despite the strength and brilliance of creativity and genius. Of course there has been much back and forth around who was right and who was wrong in the Ted Hughes-Sylvia Plath marriage. I must say that the film is extremely fair and even-handed, never fully taking the part of Hughes over Plath or Plath over Hughes.It is extremely difficult to make an interesting movie about a depressed creative genius and at least this film attempts to explore the untreated clinical depression that plagued Plath and made her life miserable and drove her husband away.  What a complete tragedy that the artist found that the very quality within her that was making her miserable also drove away the person she loved most and thus even made her more miserable.  Is there any character in mythology who found that the more they approached the beloved, the more the very act of approach drove the beloved away?  This was the dilemma that Plath faced.I was also touched by the struggle that Plath underwent being pulled into the world of the living by her children, her guilt about leaving them motherless, and yet the depressed undercurrent continually pulling her into the land of the dead.  There is a scene of almost unspeakable pain where Plath puts her children in a car and drives to the ocean where she plans to drown herself. She looks back at the car before walking into the rough surf and sees the tiny innocent eyes of her children watching her every move.  She just could not kill herself at that point and reluctantly and defeated she returns to the world of the living.Yet there is a flaw in the film that is difficult to address. For basically we see a terrible tragedy of a depressed woman lose her husband through jealousy and insecurity and then finally commit suicide and yet we only get a few glimpses of her brilliance. What a struggle her life must have been and yet there were periods of great creativity as evidenced by her life's workGwyneth Paltrow does a great job and is perfectly matched by Daniel Craig as Ted Hughes.  The photography and art direction are a concert in gray and black, moody colors to match the brooding depression in Sylvia's mind.",4.0,1.0,1,1,-0.2023,negative,-0.9849,very negative,2009,8,31

Caine plays Carter with ice-cold water running through his veins, and the bleak Newcastle setting compliments the hard, merciless atmosphere of a period that gave us 'A Clockwork Orange' and 'Straw Dogs'. It's less violent than the latter, and Carter, although doomed, has a twisted moral core. But it's still strong stuff, and the ending is also very 70's in that it's not very happy, not that 'Get Carter' is a particularly happy film anyway. Whilst it was a cult hit at the time, and languished in obscurity in the 80s, a spate of television repeats and a shift in the zeitgeist made it the ne plus ultra of urban chic in the mid-90s, and it's now regarded as something of a classic. It's also worth checking out the contemporary 'Villain', a less-famous (for good reason - it isn't very good) film starring Richard Burton, for an example of how badly it could have gone. It's also one of the most misquoted films ever ('You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full time job'), and Michael Caine justifies 'The Swarm', 'Jaws IV' and 'The Holcroft Covenant' with his performance. Special note must be made of Harold Budd's music, in particular the title track, a simple melody that has been an inspiration to ambient musicians ever since, and the soundtrack is a cult favourite. Thankfully, some care has been put into the DVD - there are audio commentaries and a couple of amusingly old-fashioned trailers. At one point Carter transforms a man into a dummy and throws him from a multi-storey car park, revealing hitherto-unknown supernatural powers. The same car park is on the verge of demolition today, but may become a listed building because of the film.

At the ripe age of 13, Kiki has  to go out and find her place in the world.  To train for one year and find  what she is good at.Famed Director Hiyao Mizasaki does give Kiki any  hidden talents, any grand abilities...actually Kiki is can't do anything  other than the typical flying on a broomstick (a standard ability among  witches).

However, I am a fan of much of Wagner's work.  After the initial shock when the opening credits rolled by, I settled into what was an honestly unique experience.Harlock (actually the son of Leiji Matsumoto's original Harlock) is the captain of the Arcadia, a space pirate vessel.  Accompanying him are his close friend Tochiro, Chief cook and engineering mate Yattran, and Meeme a mysterious woman who is rumored to be a sorceress of an ancient and fearsome race.  The story opens with Tochiro and Harlock's sister Emareldas trying to track down Meeme, who disappeared from the Arcadia unexpectedly.  They find a projection of her in the ruins of the asteroid Aclucion, where she warns them that another pirate is about to raid the planet Rhein in order to gain the Rheingold.  Harlock races to the planet, but is not in time.  Now this intrepid gang must trace the gold across the universe.As they try to prevent the gold from being made into the ring that rules time, Meeme explains that the pirate is Alberich of the Nibelungs, her brother.  He wants the ring to challenge Wotan and destroy Valhalla, little caring that this will destroy the universe as well.  Of course, the crew of the Arcadia fails again and the ring is made.  Now all, good and evil alike, flock to Valhalla where this recasting of Wagner's story reaches its climax as Harlock struggles to avert the Twilight of the Gods.  As you can see, the story truly is pure space opera.This is pure fun right out of Flash Gordon, but with classical music.  Director Yoshi Takeuchi commits almost every dramatic sin there is, and the English language version compounds this excess into a perfect confection.  Be warned, set playback to the Japanese version with subtitles or risk dying from unrelenting over-acting.  What you have to keep in mind is that this file was never meant to be either a faithful rendition of Wagner's operas of a perfect redaction of Matsumoto's manga.  Rather, it is intended to recreate the style of its sources and provide high entertainment.  And that it does exceedingly well.This is a long presentation (about 150 minutes) in six episodes.  Unlike some manga adaptations, considerable effort is spent of providing continuity.  So there is little confusion to detract from the excellent graphic design, art work, and the great musical score.  I found the ending a bit anticlimactic, but not unbearably so.  The action during most of the film makes up for that particular weakness.  After all, there are only so many planets you can blow up before a certain amount of ennui leaks in.

I also thought Smallville was about a dude controlling or interacting with aliens (like X-files or something)...then the more episodes I watched the more it started to make sense. I was a fan!I had to get the box set because I had to watch everything from the beginning. Every single episode is EXCITING! None boring.

Clark is every woman's dream with the sensitivity issue...he says all the right things...the woman are already feeling him on that...why can't they find him a girl though to hold him over til Lois Lane? We all know that he doesn't end up with Lana in the end plus The Cat and mouse thing with Lana gets a bit tired at times. I can bet if the series goes to Metropolis when Clark is all grown up....guess who will play Lois? Kristin Kreuk.Everyone does great in this series especially Michael Rosenbaum as Lex, I actually felt sorry for Lex at times because he too has tons of issues, half the time he is lonely and drinking some sort of alchohol beverage or driving around in the latest sports car...filling this void, you almost wish he never turns into THE Lex Luthor...but just like Anaken SkyWalker in Star Wars episode II who turns into the Evil Darth Vader Lex changes too...sadly...his character is very likable, most of the times he means well but it just ends up looking bad for him no matter what he does.I haven't seen season 2 yet (awaiting it's arrival to purchase it) The season one price was a bit high but definitely worth it though, bonuses, interactivity, it's great, recommended.

By the end of the film, you want to take a shower and crawl into bed to get some rest.The Roger of the title is a womanizing scumball brainiac whose speech is as highly controlled as his love life is absolutely out of control. This shark loves the ladies, to a fault; by mentally assassinating them before making any kind of move, he ruins his chances continuously. You can see this routine might of work with younger, unsuspecting college girls, but as Roger is aging, the act is failing. Ironically, his nephew shows up to seek advice about the ladies, so Roger spends most of the film poisioning this young lad's mind about the ways of the love world, possibly validating the claim: &quot;Those who can't anymore, teach.&quot;Roger is expertly played by Campbell Scott, a highly undervalued actor in cinema today. He walks the fine line between making Roger just scumbag enough to abhor him, and brings a remarkable vulnerability to him at the right times. Equally compelling is Jennifer Beals as a temporary seductress to nephew Nick, and yes, Elizabeth Berkley shines (it's time we get over Showgirls). The successful script, combined with the great cast, make for a great movie experience.One problem I have is with the overuse of the &quot;shaky camera&quot;, which the filmmakers immediately defend in their commentary and bonus features tracks. When I first saw &quot;Roger Dodger&quot; in the theater, I almost felt, fearing motion sickness with the shaky cam. But soon, I fell into it and didn't notice it as much. At home, the reaction is similiar, but somehow, more jarring. Some scenes are almost unwatchable with the shakiness.  I appreciate the reason why they chose that method, but find it to take away from the impact of some scenes. &quot;Shaky cam&quot; is okay, but sometimes, this is &quot;earthquake cam&quot;.Overall, Roger Dodger carries well. As secrets are revealed at the end, and the real truth comes out, it somehow seems right.

672374,B00005OCK9,A1HUYWW1EBMR6N,10,10,2001-12-27,Decent Extras,"Although it isn't listed on the Amazon description. the &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot; DVD has a commentary track featuring the two female stars of the movie and a Peter Cushing expert. I'm glad they managed to work in a commentary track on at least one of these DVD releases although it would be nice if they had done both movies. The Dalek documentary is fairly interesting as well. The thing I always ask myself when I see these sorts of things is &quot;Where are all these Dr. Who enthusiasts?&quot;. You don't see them like you used to. Maybe I'm just too young and missed the boat or something.Dr. Who and the Daleks is a slightly different and upgraded version of the original Dalek story. Peter Cushing is an elderly man named &quot;Dr. Who&quot; who lives with his two granddaughters and invented a time machine in his back yard. While showing it off to his grand daughter's date (Ian) they are all accidentally sent to another planet where they meet the Dalek's. An alien race that was so mutated by a great war that they had to build special machines to live in. They are now evil and bent on destruction of all non Dalek life forms. This movie has a lot of great visuals but can be difficult to watch by even the most hardened Dr. Who fans.Dalek Invasion of Earth 2150 AD is also an altered version of an original Dr. Who story. The Dr. and his granddaughters pick up a different male companion and end up on earth in the far future where the Dalek's have conquered the planet. With a little ingenuity and dumb luck they free the earth from the Dalek's tyranny. This movie, while again having pretty good visuals, is even more difficult to watch than the first. But it has it's moments. My favorite scene is at the beginning when the police man stumbles into the Tardis. I'm a little upset because I recall this scene as originally being before the opening credits (at least that's where it is on the video release) which added a lot more drama and excitement to the movie as a whole. Also, somehow the Doctor manages to return the officer back to before the time he was taken which is a paradox that makes absolutely no sense.Dalekmania, while being a cheap and boring documentary, gives some good insight into the whole Dr. Who film phenomena thingy. You learn some interesting tid bits like they wanted to make a 3rd movie for about 20 years after the release of the 2nd film. They considered everything from adapting the 3rd Dalek storyline &quot;The Chase&quot; to making a Dalek movie without the Doctor at all.Bottom Line... I like this collection but I recommend it ONLY for people who are big Dr. Who fans or big Peter Cushing fans.",4.0,1.0,1,1,0.0,neutral,0.9741,very positive,2001,12,27

And Malcolm McDowell is a hoot as the deputy. I actually liked him in Rob Zombie's Halloween, even though many didn't. Here, McDowell is even better though. He acts like he's in a comedy instead of a horror film, hamming it up every chance he gets. There is some nudity, though not as much as in the 1984 original. In that movie, there were three women who got naked. In this one, there is only one. I do think that this version is a lot gorier, though.

We learn that they are Protestants, and that they don't agree with the religious beliefs of Queen Mary (Kathy Burke), a Catholic. Soon enough, a young woman is also arrested. She is Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett), stepsister to Mary, and a Protestant. Elizabeth is accused of treason, and sent to the Tower, in order to wait for her fate to be decided...Of course, nothing happens, and our main character continues to live allowing the film to continue, but those first scenes give us a glimpse of what kind of life Elizabeth must have led in her youth, amid constant fear of execution and whispers of betrayal. Not much afterwards, though, Queen Mary dies and Elizabeth becomes Elizabeth I. She will have more power, but also new responsibilities and different threats...Elizabeth will have to deal with the pressure of most of her advisors to choose soon among the candidates that have asked for her hand in marriage, but she is unable to marry the one she loves, Lord Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes). She is surrounded by many Catholic-led conspiracies, and by quite a few that wish her ill, starting by the powerful Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston). Despite that, and thanks to her inner strenght and the counsel of a new advisor, Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush), Elizabeth slowly becomes a ruler who is not afraid to make difficult decisions to stay in power, even if that involves killing those who plot against her. She seems to remember that ""I am my father's daughter. I am not afraid of anything"".I believe that this movie tackles quite well the idea of how difficult it was to be a woman with power in Elizabeth's time, and how far a female ruler had to go to retain that power. The cast is superb, although I think that it is possible to say that Cate Blanchett's performance is the most remarkable one. I would like to add that the art direction was quite good, and that it helped to recreate the atmosphere of days long gone...Of course, I am aware of the fact that this film is full of historical inaccuracies, but I already knew that it wasn't a documentary. Despite that, ""Elizabeth"" left me wanting to know more about the period in which all these events happened, and I am probably going to read a book on it  :)On the whole, I highly recommend this film. It is interesting, and different. ""Elizabeth"" doesn't have much to do with historical reality, but it was inspired by it, and it might spur you to learn more about the period through other sources. What is more important, you will get at least a clue of what drove a young woman like Elizabeth to remain single, married only to England...Belen Alcat",4.0,0.6666666666666666,1,2,-0.3595,negative,0.9577,very positive,2005,4,5

Devil Hunter Yohko, or in its original name, Mamoto Hunter Yohko, is anime that is anything but silly.  As a female anime fan, I found it empowering.  I don't feel the nudity is gratuitous.  Part of the story concerns Yohko coming to terms with her sexuality, and later claiming it, as well as the mantle of Demon Hunter.  We all make the choice (hopefully it is not forced on us) as when and how to engage in sexual activity for the first time.  When is the right time?  Who is the right person?  And what are the consequences of our choices?  These are all questions that young women deal with every day.  Yohko's choices and near-mistakes are as serious as the ones we make.Philosopy aside, this is vastly entertaining.  The series has engaging characters whom most of us can recognize in our own lives.  I agree with the reviewer who said Yohko's grandmother is her favorite.  Yohko's devotion to her Obasan is touching.  Other great characters include Yohko's flaky but caring mother, Yohko's best friend, and a nerdy boy at school.Overall, this DVD retains an innocent and noble quality despite a few blatantly sexual scenes.  It is noble because of the good versus evil story, and boy, this is some serious evil.  You will be on the edge of your seat cheering for Yohko.

He is brilliant, thoughtless and socially incompetent (maybe a touch of Asperger's?). Oblivious to the hurt he inflicts in that perfectly fine young woman, his first on-line venture springs from his desire to strike back at her.This perfectly cast film boasts the following characters:*  Jesse Eisenberg (""Zombieland"") IS Zuckerberg: smart, ambitious and emotionally isolated.*  Andrew Garfield (""Boy A"") is perfect as his patient and much-exploited roommate and would-be friend.

Sure, the grotesque severed and rotting hand will grab attention--but those looking for a graphic horror story will likely feel a bit short changed by the actual film. And those that might appreciate the film's subtlety and surprisingly gentle tone might be put off by the awesome unpleasantness of this image. So to help better align viewer expectations, I'll say that ""Matrimony"" plays as a moody ghost story as opposed to a grisly shocker. And in contrast to many of the Asian supernatural pictures that have flooded the DVD marketplace, this isn't just an ominous spectre wreaking havoc and death--this is one with love in her heart and a plan to win her man back at any cost.After a surreal and dreamlike opening in which a man loses his fiance to a tragic accident, the film settles into the main story line. The man (a solid Leon Lai), now unhappily attached in an arranged marriage, can't relinquish the spirit of his true love. But his current wife (a radiant Rene Liu) has genuine feelings for her husband. When approached by the restless spirit of the other woman (Fan Bing Bing), Liu forms a tentative partnership to try to bring peace and lightness into Lai's life. But as joy starts to creep back into the man's world, both of his loves seem to be waging a battle for his affection. Only one problem--both have to do it through the corporeal presence of the lady with an actual body! Things get decidedly more bleak as it becomes clear that co-existence is no longer a viable proposition.""Matrimony"" isn't necessarily the most original film you're likely to encounter, but it has a genuine sweetness at its core. For me, this was its most surprising element. As wallflower Liu starts to gain confidence and the attention of her husband, she literally lights up the screen. And their relationship develops in believable ways as their shared past is revealed in flashbacks. This really is a story of love lost AND love found, and the principle actors bring real depth to the narrative. The fact that you care about the outcome makes the final confrontations more impactful. Again, this is more character driven than horror infused--like an adult ghost story. There's a bit of a twist, which you may love or hate, but ends things on a poetic note. A pleasant and sweet surprise--despite what the DVD artwork would have you believe. KGHarris, 7/11.",4.0,1.0,3,1,0.6369,very positive,0.9968,very positive,2011,7,19

""The Pirates of Penzance"" (with Frederick about to be terminated)? Really. I'm not kidding.The complaint that the first hour (heck, most of the film) is confusing, holds some water. But plenty of hints are dropped, if you're paying attention. The climax has Vincent Price, as Mark Cardigan (!), a Flynn-like actor at the end of his career, leading a posse of Mexican police to save Mitchum.This genre mixing doesn't work well, not so much because of the disparity, but because Price's scenes run on much too long. This weakens the film's tension, when it could have been used to heighten it. They could easily have been trimmed.Mitchum is repeatedly beaten up, though mostly off-camera. But one beating has to be one of the worst, if not /the/ worst, beatings in a Code film.Good performances all around, including the often-flat Jane Russell, and especially Price. Price is still in the ""serious actor"" part of his career, and avoids going overboard. (If you'd like an even better example of his comedic skills, catch ""Champagne for Caesar"".)

It is as much a story of bruised families as it is an introduction to the forces behind Lennon's formation of what was to become The Beatles, probably the most influential musical group of the 1960s and 1970s who all but defined that period in our history.John Lennon (Aaron Johnson) lives with his stern guardian aunt Mimi (Kristin Scott Thomas) and beloved uncle George (David Threlfall) in Liverpool.  At film's beginning Uncle George die suddenly and at the funeral John sees his biologic mother Julia (Anne-Marie Duff) who deserted John when he was 5 years old only to marry and have two daughters living not far form her sister Mimi.  John seeks out Mimi, discovers she is a freewheeling music buff who is not only glad to re-connect with her son but also finds him physically attractive.  Mimi's common-law husband Bobby (David Morrissey) finds John's intrusion into his family (the two have two daughters) disturbing.  But as John becomes more fascinated with being with his birth mother he learns banjo and guitar and gets the urge to imitate Elvis Presley - an infatuation that leads the 15-year-old John to form a band called Quarrymen, soon joined by Paul McCartney (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) and George Harrison (Sam Bell).  The group becomes locally successful but John's attention to Mimi proves problematic and Julia and Mimi spar for John's attention and love.  How John Lennon rises above his roots and retains love for both 'mothers' provides a touching ending to a movie and an apropos beginning to understanding  the success of the Beatles.Aaron Johnson captures the personality formation of john Lennon as well as any actor to date and his performance is excellent.  He is equally matched by the polished performances of Kristin Scott Thomas and Anne-Marie Duff. NOWHERE BOY is an entertaining and nostalgic film well worth watching.

The BR contains some Bonus-Features like Bloopers, deleted scenes, behind the scenes and 3 documentaries with a lenght of 1 hour together.

Its a true comic-masterpiece. Common - Murphy was only half that good.In this Box are two more DVDs with two movies:&#34;Cinderfella&#34; (Jerry Lewis as Cinderella)and&#34;The Errand Boy&#34; - a fantastic comedy (ok, it doesn't have really a &#34;Story&#34;) but has some great gags. Its a parody about the movie studios and plays in the fictional studio &#34;Paramutual&#34; (which means clearly &#34;Paramount&#34; which was filmed &#34;on location) and has a great Cameo of the &#34;Bonanza&#34;-Cast.My favorite Gag is the Cantine/Candy-Shop Scene.

1660577,B00DQN6IOK,A79U01AE98EV8,18,23,2013-09-20,The unimaginable - a boring Falstaff,"The Crown Jewel of this set is surely ""Richard II"" with a toweringly masterful performance by Ben Whitslaw.  Everything about the production is right - the sets, the symbols, the costumes, the supporting players (except for the actor playing Aumerle who spends the film looking woefully dumbfounded and lost).  This is a Richard for the ages.Then we come to Henry IV I starring Jeremy Irons as a roughhewn Henry whose kingdom seems overrun by rebels from every corner.  He is by turns pensive, fiery, sad, fatherly, and tough as nails.  His berating of the recalcitrant Hal is masterful as his rage becomes palpable.  His death scene also is a revelation as Irons gives a master class in the art of acting.But how sad it is to yearn for Henry to come back in frame,  There will be no yearning here however. The play has two father figures for Hal to choose from and Henry is usually the dark, scolding one while sweet Jack Falstaff lightens the somber mood that lours over this not so merry England, providing the audience with much needed comic relief.  Well, Simon Russell Beale does everything in his power to deaden the character.  It is Falstaff who is the tired scold, a scowling drunk who has no levity in him.  One might argue that Shakespeare's characters are there to be interpreted and so this interpretation of the fat knight is as valid as any other.  Ah, but one would not want to see a Macbeth smile gleefully while reciting his ""If it were done"" speech or for Lady Macbeth to skip and dance through her sleepwalking scene, much less to see Hamlet laugh hysterically while listening to the ghost of his dead father recalling his murder most foul, because these interpretations would cut against the grain of the characters as written and make a mockery of the plays while insulting the audience's taste.  People laugh at this Falstaff (indeed Tim Hiddleston cannot keep a straight face when he is within ten yards of the man) but one can only wonder what they are laughing and guffawing at.  It is akin to watching Chris Rock being portrayed by Ben Stein (or Hoffman as Lenny Bruce for that matter) - the lines may be good but the delivery is much like that of a garbage truck.  One cannot of course be sure where the fault lies, in the star or in the director (who, in the bonus featurette praises Beale to the skies), but dread fault it is.  Why would Hal seek a man as craggy as his father to hang out with?  It's analogous to someone swearing off Jonathan Winters to hang out with Robin Williams - going from steak to hamburger.  One can almost envisage the planning that went into this - ""Tell you what. .let's do someting radical, something no one would expect. .a Falstaff with a perpetual frownlet on.  That'll get them talking.""  This is the only production of the Henriad in which the audience sympathizes with Hal's ditching the knight.  I will admit this: Beale's expression when Hal banishes him is heartbreaking - but certainly would have been more so had his Falstaff ever come across as more than a rather sad figure whose jollity is but a thin mask for his life weariness.Let me make it clear that it is not Beale's acting which is at fault.  He is a very good actor who is misguidedly playing the wrong part.  Were he playing Jacques in ""As You Like It"" he'd steal the show.  You want a great Falstaff?  Try Roger Allam's ingenious portrayal in the RSC series or the almost as good Anthony Quayle in the BBC production from the early 1980s.""Henry V"" opens with the king's funeral and with the gravelly fine narration of the grand John Hurt evoking a ""Muse of Fire"".  Hiddleston acquits himself admirably.  His line readings are natural, bespeaking a man casting himself in a new mold having spent years learning the world of taverns and whores and thieves.  His ""St. Crispian"" speech is spoken rather than bellowed which, though unorthodox, is dramatically effective.The bonus scenes accompanying the DVDs offer little besides pats on the backs for the directors and stars, which is what one expects, but it would have been so much better to have someone speak of Shakespeare's art and the way he molded and shaped historical events to suit the drama.  Hotspur, for example, was at least 45 at the Battle of Shrewsbury, but the last thing the Bard needed was an additonal father figure and so 45 becomes 20.  Too, ""Henry V"" (as do the rest of these plays)raises important questions about the nature of kingship.  Is Henry a good king or a cold war mongerer willing to sacrifice untold thousands for the glitter and dust of personal glory?  How did the Tudor myth of the king or queen as God's own appointed influence Shakespeare's characterization of Richard II?  After all, no one in the 14th century thought of a king as God's viceroy on earth.  He was simply the first among many.  These issues might have been effectively addressed in the bonus featurettes rather than the tired old ""He is the best actor/director/costume designer/stunt coordinator it has been my pleasure to work with.""The set is worth purchasing if only for Ben, Rory Kinnear, and Jeremy Irons, but I daresay most will fast forward Falstaff which is a damn shame as he is one of Shakespeare's finest creations.",4.0,0.782608695652174,1,1,-0.3182,negative,0.8878,very positive,2013,9,20

This movie surpasses the original as far as story development. We learn a good bit about each character's past, which helps justify all the extreme violence they engage themselves in. We're also introduced to some new characters and plot lines that add interest and new twists, rather than just rehashing all the familiar faces from Underworld.Kate Beckinsale delivers a performance that shows she is a very versatile actress who just so happens to be strikingly beautiful, and Scott Speed man was more than just a little eye-candy for the ladies, delivering a performance that made me believe he was the perfect Michael Corvin far more than the first film. And the supporting casts around the two main stars were all equally up to the task, with many turning in performances that are likely to be career defining.Hats off to Len Wiseman for living up to a last name that couldn't be more fitting. He never compromises his vision, and more importantly the story by trying to woo the crowd with over-the-top (Matrix-y) action scenes or gratuitous sexual imagery, as many directors do to try to win over their audiences, and yet the movie has some of the best action scenes the genre has seen in years, and a sexual chemistry between Selene and Michael that is very believable, and yet not over-done. Even in one very intimate scene between them, it is never excessive or tasteless.Let's face it. If you're going to purchase this movie, you probably enjoyed the original and are looking for more. You want high doses of fight scenes, vampire and lycan lore, blood, violence, and Kate Beckinsale wearing leather or less. In short, this movie delivers all of the above in great excess, so if you liked Underworld, you're going to like Underworld: Evolution as much or more.On the other hand, if you don't like blood, violence, action, mythology, or using a sword in a world full of guns, this movie is not for you, and it's NOT MEANT to be for you.

I am not here for that especially since I have not seen the original in years. I do remember it of course but it would be unfair to compare since I could be forgetting things. So as for this one I will review it kinda like it is a stand alone, although we all know better.Blackwood Manor in Rhode Island is a house that would be perfect for any family looking to settle down. The only problem is that it has a dark past that may still be lurking around. That is the thing that the Hurst family is about learn about as they are the family moving in.

So while doing so they uncover the basement and something about the fireplace is out of whack. Of course that could have just been the voices Sally is hearing that make it seem that way. These voices keep calling to her and that fire place may be where they are coming from.I thought this was a pretty good flick from first time director Troy Nixey and writers Matthew Robbins and Guillermo Del Toro. The setting and mood of the film are perfect as not only the house but outside of it gives off that somewhat gothic feel. Atmosphere and feel are major for any flick and this one as that feeling. Of course we then have the performances from the cast that are just as good. Guy and Katie are good of course but I feel like and rightfully so that Bailee Madison is the best here. After all it is her character that the film is mainly based around.The creatures here which are fairies are cool looking little things and I like that these types of flicks are still made.

Hoffman, was given its world premiere by the Metropolitan Opera, and this is the 1992 telecast of that very production. It featured a large cast, headed by Teresa Stratas, Hkan Hagegrd, Gino Quilico, Marilyn Horne, Graham Clark, and Ren&eacute;e Fleming, and was a magnificent achievement.Hoffman's text is brilliant, and while Corigliano's score is a pastiche, it is an impressive one. He imitates styles from that of Mozart (to boring effect) to the twentieth-century avant-garde (to thrilling effect). It's also rather lengthy: It surprises one that composers and playwrights continue to score such expansive evenings while their audiences' attention-spans grow ever briefer. Previously, Colin Graham's productions at the Met included a very prosaic ""La traviata"" (1981), so this astonishing staging may come as a surprise. It is endlessly inventive, and takes full advantage of the company's theatrical possibilities.Stratas is extraordinary as the misunderstood Marie Antoinette, giving her all in a controlled, gripping performance. She is the cynosure of the production. Hagegrd sings the role of Beaumarchais gloriously, and Quilico is the ideal Figaro, oozing with charm and athletic magnetism. Horne gives, as might be expected from her, a bravura performance as the exotic Samira. Clark is truly malevolent as the horrible B&eacute;gearss (and gives us a morsel of the evil that was the French Revolution), and gives a complete characterization. Fleming, as the Countess Almaviva, is heard here before she turned every score into ""jazz,"" and makes us regret what might have been possible in her career.Several of the other roles are particularly well-cast, especially Tracy Dahl, and Ara Berberian who is heard (not seen) as the Pasha, and Dean Badolato who is seen (not heard) as his Page.

Christian went to hit Shelton, but Shelton kicked it into the face of Christian. Christian and the referee got into a tug of war over the belt and then Shelton came off the top with a clothesline for two. The referee disposed of the belt, but Tomko came inside and knocked Shelton down and then Christian covered for two. Shelton then hit Tyson off the apron with a wicked Dragon whip and then Christian went for the Unprettier, but Shelton reversed into his Exploder Suplex and made the cover for the win! Good match!Winner via Pinfall: Shelton BenjaminRating: 7/10Backstage:Kurt Angle was shown backstage and then came across Edge. Kurt said he read Edge's book and he said he didn't appreciate what Edge said about him. Kurt asked how it felt for the fans to pick Shawn Michaels over him. Edge said that he will get his title shot after he wins tonight. Edge said after Taboo Tuesday he took Michaels out, something Kurt has never done. Eugene then bumped into Kurt and spouted off the Kurt'saccomplishments before starting a You Suck chant!3rd match: John Cena, The Big Show, Rob Van Dam and Eddie Guerrero vs. Carlito Carribbean Cool, Luther Reigns, Mark Jindrak and Kurt Angle in an Elimination Match:The finish:Angle began to leave, but RVD came into the aisle and backed Angle back to the ring. Big Show came behind Kurt and Kurt walked right into him. Kurt went for a right, but Big Show hit a knee to the gut and then sent Angle inside, allowing Cena to hit the FU on Kurt Angle. Eddie Guerrero then went up top and came off with the Frog Splash on Angle. Big Show crawled back into the ring and made the cover, and this one is over!Survivors: John Cena, Eddie Guerrero and The Big ShowRating: 8/10Backstage:The Coach is backstage with Maven and Coach said that Maven doesn't deserve to be in the match. Maven cut him off and Maven said he was going to give Coach a personal demonstration of why he deserves it. Snitsky then attacked Maven from behind and brutally went to work on Maven and Snitsky is a mad man. Maven is busted open pretty bad as some agents helped him up to his feet.4th match: The Undertaker vs. Heidenreich:The finish:The Undertaker whipped Heidenreich, but Heidenreich reversed and locked in a sleeper, but the Undertaker back suplexed out of it. Both men are down and the referee reached an eight count but Taker sat up. Taker hit a flying clothesline on Heidenreich and called for another chokeslam. Taker grabbed him by the throat and scored with the chokeslam. The Undertaker then signalled for the Tombstone and picked up Heidenreich and hit the Tombstone. The Undertaker then covered for the victory!Winner via Pinfall: The UndertakerRating: 8/10Backstage:Maria was backstage with Eric Bischoff and asked for an update on Maven. Eric said it appears as if Maven will not be able to compete tonight. She then asked if there will be a replacement. Eric said he is hours away from taking his first vacation in years. If he named a replacement, Triple H and his team would protest and instead of being on a beach, he would be round a table with a board of directors. No one is going to replace Maven, and that is final.5th match: Trish Stratus (c)vs. Lita for the Women's Championship:Lita got in the ring and gave Trish a straight right. Lita then went to work on Trish with some more right hands and then a slap. Lita gave Trish some more rights in the corner and then took her down to the mat and mounted her with more punches, sending Trish to the outside. Trish fought back and sent Lita head first into the announce table, but then Lita sent Trish face first into a chair. Lita grabbed a steel chair and hammered away at Trish and the referee has called for the bell.Winner: No ContestRating: 2/10The Aftermath:Trish is busted open and Lita locked in a rear naked choke on Lita and Lita has snapped here at the Survivor Series. Trish's nose looks to be broken and she is in a lot of pain and then Lita attacked Trish from behind, sending her into the steel steps. The fans chanted for Lita and Trish was helped to the backBackstage:Backstage, Eddie and Big Show were with John Cena. Theodore Long walked in and thanked them for an outstanding match. Long said he wanted to talk to Cena. Long congratulated Cena on a speedy recovery and said it was good to have him back. Cena said Carlito just walked out like nothing happened tonight. Long said that won't be the case this Thursday. He is ordering Carlito to appear on Smackdown! this week, and he will be defending the United States Championship, and if he doesn't show up, he will strip him of the title. Long said Carlito will go one on one with John Cena this Thursday, Holla.6th match: John Bradshaw Layfield (c) vs. Booker T for the WWE Championship:The finish:JBL went for the Clothesline from Hell, but Booker hit a super kick and then knocked Orlando off the apron. Booker then hit the Scissors Kick on JBL and made the cover and another referee ran down and got to two before Orlando pulled him out. Jordan came inside with the belt but was given the Book End. JBL then hit Booker with the title and made the cover just as the referee was coming around and got the three count.Winner via Pinfall: John Bradshaw LayfieldRating: 8/10WWE In Iraq:Footage was shown of last year when WWE went out to visit the troops in Iraq, and announced they are heading back there for this upcoming Holiday Season.Backstage:Evolution were shown backstage, and Batista said Snitsky and Edge want the World Title.

Triple H then came inside and hit a big spinebuster on Orton. Triple H held Orton up and Edge went for the Spear, but Orton moved and Edge speared the Game, and then Orton hit the RKO on Edge and pinned him, and Edge is out of there! It's down to Randy Orton and Triple H. Orton stared down Triple H but the referee was distracted with Edge. Orton went for the RKO, but Triple H hit a low blow on Orton. Triple H went for the Pedigree but Orton span around and hit the RKO out of nowhere and Orton has won it!Survivor: Randy OrtonRating: 10/10The Aftermath:Randy Orton celebrated his victory over the World Heavyweight Champion and he is the sole survivor here tonight. Orton then looked down at Triple H on the outside and mounted off at him.

I was excited to see the release of the standard DVD remastered versions and they do not dissapoint for the most part.  The recreations are very good and fit nicely in to the episodes.  They episodes still have a ""modern"" feel, but do retain almost all of the original charm. I think the planet and ship digitizations are right on the mark.  I do have an up converting DVD player and the quality of the remastering most definately is noticed.  Some people have complained about the new theme music and/or the new digital additions, but I have no issues.  I really think EVERY Star Trek fan needs to have these versions.  Also, they are in 1:33 format as the original productions and while some have criticized that as well, I also see no issues.  The Uniforms and all scenes are sharper and the sound is fantastic.  I do have two criticisms that prevent 5 stars.  There is NO english subtitles and MOST OF ALL, there is NO printing of the disks, just left alone with no data except for season and disk information.  It would have been excellent had Paramount/CBS spend a few more cents per disk to print logos, episode information etc.  I did end up printing my own labels, and is the only way to view the episodes on each disk.  This is incredible thatthey were so cheap! But other than that, I am pleased and feel the blank printing is not enough to prevent anybody from buying this set (or the other seasons).",4.0,0.0,1,3,0.6369,very positive,0.8712,very positive,2009,9,24
764080,B0000AKY3Q,A1SQFUCSPMUE8I,96,101,2003-09-05,5-star show gets imperfect DVD treatment...but IT'S ALRIGHT,"What young person can't remember spending their Saturday mornings watching the adventures of Zack and company at Bayside High on NBC's ""Saved By The Bell""? Those who cannot perhaps have fond memories of watching the show in its popular syndicated airings on TBS. It's tough to stumble across anyone between the ages of 15 and 30 who hasn't seen most episodes and many more than once. If you're reading this, chances are you too remember the fun adventures high school provided for Zack, Slater, Screech, Kelly, Jessie, Lisa and their principal Mr. Belding in this excellent late '80s/early '90s sitcom.With TV series as popular as they now are on DVD, and with this show relegated to early morning and lunch hour airings (inconvenient for most), what better time to release the first two seasons of ""Saved By The Bell"" to DVD?This 5-disc set from Lions Gate Entertainment contains the first 33 episodes of ""Saved By The Bell."" The season that preceded the years at Bayside - ""Good Morning Miss Bliss"" (sometimes referred to as ""Saved By The Bell: The Junior High Years"" on TBS) - is unfortunately NOT included here.  That series, which made its debut on The Disney Channel in 1988 and ran for 13 episodes, will hopefully be released at some point in the future. In addition to star Hayley Mills in the title role, the series featured four ""SBTB"" regulars. Although it differed in tone from the series that became such a hit and revolutionized the Saturday morning lineup, it is quite enjoyable in its own right, and very much deserves to be released to DVD.The 33 episodes that are included are arranged by airdate, not production order, which essentially means you should watch the episode ""King of the Hill"" (which is on Disc 3) first - it's the pilot of this series and is about the first day of school when Zack meets Slater). Other than that, there aren't any noticeable continuity issues watching the episodes the way they are arranged.Some of my favorite episodes in this set:""The Gift"" (Screech is struck by lightning and can see the future),""Rent-a-Pop"" (Zack gets James the actor/waiter to impersonate his father so he can go on a ski trip),""Aloha, Slater"" (Zack convinces the gang that Slater is dying so he'll move to Hawaii),""Save the Max"" (The old Bayside radio station is rediscovered and put to use),""Running Zack"" (Zack actually does research for a school assignment)I do have a few minor quibbles. Even though there is space in the package for a booklet, there is none - so, there are no descriptions of the episodes, which might make it challenging for those who don't know all the episodes by title alone. Speaking of the package, be careful when peeling the sticker off the top. For some reason, it was placed right on top of the cardboard box instead of the plastic wrapping, so unless you're skillful (or some have suggested, have a hair dryer handy to heat the sticker), you're liable to take off some of the top of the front cover off when opening.Another minor annoyance is that there are no chapter stops within the episodes, so you'll have to scan to get to a specific scene. It would have been nice (and easy) for chapter stops to have been included where commercial breaks would be, a practice common with most other studios.Video quality is mostly fine, but a few of the earliest-produced episodes look worse than they probably should - lacking the sharpness of broadcast quality. The overwhelming majority looks okay, but they won't blow you away or anything. (It's probably unreasonable to expect they would.) Audio quality is also less-than-perfect (the volume level sometimes seems inconsistent), but listening at a reasonable volume, this is a non-issue.As for supplemental material, this set gets a zero. As others have stated in their comments, the show certainly has potential for some nice bonus features. Naturally, I don't expect a 2-hour making-of documentary, but there are little things that would have been nice to include. Like the cast's other NBC TV appearances, or even NBC's ""The More You Know"" sequences featuring the cast members that every major teen idol seems to have done at one point. There is the strong ""E! True Hollywood Story"" special that aired last December, which would be nice to include.And chances are, some of the cast would participate in DVD bonus features, had they been approached, which they were not according to Mario Lopez. (Dustin Diamond, Dennis Haskins, and Peter Engel partook in interviews for the E! special; surely, they would have been interested in contributing to the DVDs.)I look forward to DVD releases for the rest of the show, plus the one-season runs of ""Good Morning, Miss Bliss"" and ""The College Years"", and the two made-for-television movies. Hopefully, some improvements will be made, and we'll see more ""Saved By The Bell"" DVDs released shortly, and with bonus features.Still, in spite of these quibbles, I still give this box set 5 stars because of the show itself. Almost of the episodes are excellent, as the deal with real issues that affect high schoolers in a skewed-for-comedy fashion. The show never really took things too seriously and when it did (for instance, Jessie's now-famous struggle with caffeine pills or the Season 4 opener in which Zack and Slater went fisticuffs), it provided even more laughs. ""Saved By The Bell"" is a one-of-a-kind sitcom and remains extremely funny over a decade later. If only high school really was like Bayside.",4.0,0.9504950495049505,1,1,0.1111,neutral,0.9989,very positive,2003,9,5

It is an outstanding portrayal of how obsession can overtake one's lilfe if one is not careful. The writing is excellent, as is the acting, and the attention to detail is superb. My problem with the DVD release is the puzzling lack of extras. It is standard to include commentaries and behind the scenes shorts when releasing DVDs, yet this DVD has nothing. It forces one to buy this disc in case there is no future release, and if there is a future release, you're now stuck with two copies and generally have wasted the money for this disc.

Usually I do the Crunch Pilates and Bootcamp DVDs, coupled with Jari Love's Ripped series, so I'm a fairly experienced exerciser.I wanted to find a cardio routine that was fast, effective, but didn't use weights, to use on my days that I don't do weight training (since unfortunately, you aren't supposed to do it every day).  All the reviews of different cardio dvds I saw had at least two or three people saying the dvd wasn't hard enough.When I saw the reviews on this DVD, I knew I had to try it out.THIS DVD IS EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE.  In half an hour, I burned 218 calories.  That's more calories per 15 minute increment than any of my other dvds.  AND, that's with me only being able to keep up about 2/3 of the time (physically I was able to, but coordination-wise, it was a no-go through some of this).The moves are fast and confusing.  It will definitely take me a while to get this routine down.  Lots of jumping around, flailing your arms around, jumping up and down, etc.  If you're in an upstairs apartment and are a morning exerciser (like me), this dvd is sure to irritate your neighbors. I recommend toe sox and foregoing shoes, just to keep a modicum of harmony in your building.I find a lot of the moves are similar to my Crunch Pilates and Crunch Bootcamp dvds, mainly the ""knee repeater"" (although they don't call it that on this dvd), and some of the arm work, and definitely the stretches at the end.This dvd isn't as hard on my knees as other dvds I've done, either.I got this dvd for the the first program, the hardcore cardio one, because I wanted a super intense, fast workout. This first program provides it.  I was definitely sweating and my heart rate was the highest I've ever seen it. I haven't tried the other two programs yet.  I'm not sure how the long green strap I received works on the second program, but when I do that one and figure it out, I'll edit my review.I take away one star because there's no counter displayed on my dvd, just ""play.""

1263732,B002DLB1H0,A1PAHNIKLRVGP1,0,0,2010-03-26,A New Vampire adventure,"I had been watching this on TV and found myself drawn to it. It has a bit of romance but it dosn't quite quench a vampire fan's thirst for love. The main characters are Vicki, Mike and Henry. Henry is nearly 500 years old and Vicki is a P.I. that he is attracted to. They end up working together on supernatural cases and though Henry is reluctant to get involved in anything not associated with him, he agrees to help Vicki.It is obvious that Henry really likes Vicki, but the season falls short of a satisfying ending. Both season one and two show Vicki is attracted to Henry, but they never seem to go through with their desires. The triangle b/t Vicki, her previous partner Mike, and Henry is a constant tease. She doesn't end up choosing, ever! In a way, I ended up bitter towards her for taking such opportunities for granted. Henry gets closest to having her, but she still rejects him in some physical and verbal ways.The entire season seemed to be focused on Henry and Vicki's friendship and the possibility of it becoming more. Leaving Henry hanging leads Henry to inviting Vicki to move with him. It is aggravating to watch her struggle with such a decision and end up in tears while a demon leaves the room in a human body. The demon tells Vicki he will see her again. Why ponder on the decision to go to a safer place? The last episode of season two will doubtlessly get viewers to try the books. Since there is no third season, the books are all viewers are left with to fill in the gaps.The episodes are much darker and occasionally bloody compared to season one. There isn't as much ""fun"" to it. Its more like a horror/supspence movie. I was disappointment with the cut offs of some good scenes that seem to end abruptly.The dvd pictures were good, but I really think season one and two could have been put together in one packet.

What I like so much about Winner's films of the '60's is how much he wizzes around the city. We are treated to location after location...so we really get a look at time and place like very few films of the period. Lots of cars and mini-skirted dolly birds with exaggerated hairdo's and eye make-up.The story is rather lame. '60's London is the star of this show. It's such a time tunnel that you'll feel quite dazed when it's over...but I think you'll be entertained.Carol White was always nice eye candy. She plays Oliver Reed's girlfriend. She stumbles and staggers through her lines (in one scene she almost falls over, in another she 'reacts' to the people in the room before she even has entered it,) but you forgive her because she had a sort of innocent charm, like this film.Reed is at his cool best. He was also at his handsomest in 1967. He handles his part with great ease.Orson Wells camps it up, maybe a little too much. Marianne Faithfull says the 'f' word...but little else.If you like and/or are interested in '60's London...don't hesitate buying this. Otherwise I'd be reluctant to recommend it.P.S.

Nicole Kidman was obviously somewhere at the beginning of her Hollywood career when she acted in this. She is refreshingly simple in her appearance, and her acting is superb - she is so expressive and she looked every bit the part for each scene she's playing. I can see why Hollywood decided to make her a megastar after performances like this.All 3 of them - Nicole Kidman, Billy Zane and Sam Neill were all fantastic actors in this film, which is also why this movie succeeds in being such a good suspense thriller. Its not too long a movie, and you can be sure you'll be holding on to your seat throughout the whole thing!Billy Zane isn't always at his best in all the movies he acts in - those of you who've seen him in other movies would know this by now - but in this gem of a movie, he really shines as an ultra-convincing psycho. He didn't overact or overplay his role and that's what made him so believable as the charismatic, charming but unpredictably mentally-twisted person his character is. Strange that I've always liked Billy Zane as an actor even though its so difficult to find him in a good movie nowadays... this is one movie I will never forget because of its great storyline, great acting, and its unique setting where almost everything takes place on a yacht drifting and drifting along in the sea... its all very nice.",4.0,1.0,1,2,0.1689,neutral,0.9921,very positive,2003,11,5

We get a window into the very posh world of the upper crust, without ever being belabored with the arctic brutality that is sometimes exhibited by that class (a term which sometimes seems ironic).  But this movie isn't really about that ... that is merely the story's terrain.The movie is full of things to like.  Brosnan's Thomas Crown very successfully lives up to being compared at the beginning to Odysseus (a character Homer described as a man who was &quot;never at a loss&quot;).  He is elegant and poised, regardless of the circumstances. His ability to always be in control and remain unruffled seems the source of his ennui, which pushes him into seeking danger just for the thrill.Russo is very formidable, which is in of itself refreshing for a Hollywood film.  She also proves right down to the skin that a woman does not have to be 21 to be beautiful.The photography and use of color assist in luring you into the movie's comfortable little world:  you simply cannot take your eyes off the color of the muted lighting in the restaurant, the details in a person's skin, or the sharp clarity of the fabric of a shirt-cuff.  The photography makes you *feel* what Crown's world feels like.And, typical of McTiernan films, there is no such thing as an &quot;extra.&quot;  Everyone we bump into is a very real, flesh and blood person who just doesn't happen to be the subject of the plot.But best of all is Crown's incredible skill at the art of deception.  Through forethought, methodical planning, and with a knowledge of misdirection, he's always tantalizingly just out of reach.In using these skills to relieve boredom, he meets someone he considers more valuable than his little kingdom.  Smartly, the film shows that Crown has to use his skills, and risk imprisonment, to get himself out of the trouble he created and ultimately to acquire what he really wants.This can really be seen as a morality play about people who love wealth and games, and then discover that those things don't fill the void inside - then, each must risk something to acquire something more important:  love.Russo's character proposes the question, &quot;Do you think there's happily-ever-after for people like us?&quot;  The film seems to answer &quot;yes&quot; - but it also suggests, like another film about a thief (Douglas Fairbanks' &quot;Thief of Bagdad&quot;), that happiness must be earned, not stolen.",4.0,1.0,1,3,0.0,neutral,0.9935,very positive,2001,7,24

Cusak and Weisz, the latent heroes.","Because of the fact that Dustin Hoffman plays the attorney for the Plaintiff in a wrongful death lawsuit (her husband, an attorney; Dylan McDermot - short cameo at beginning of movie) against a gun manufacturer; he does [mostly] everything by the book. So it's easy to somehow gloss over his character, since he comes across as the knight in shining armor for all the people who's loved ones have died due to handgun violence.Gene Hackman on the other hand, is the scheming, conniving, cold and calculating Rankin Fitch; the jury consultant for the gun manufacturer attorneys. It's easy for his character to be more dominating in the film, as he weaves some pretty evil, unscrupulous, coercive manipulations and intimidation of jury-influencing and tampering. And he has at his command, a plethora of seemingly callous ""technicians"" (automatons) to assist him.

Cusak seemingly manipulates part of the jury, but in the end he knows that they'll decide on their on account. Nick, being on the inside, with the Jury. Marlee, on the outside working the attorneys.A surprise ending (though not really unpredictable), in which Hackman really gets it ""stuck to him"".  He never knew what hit him.

702840,B000067IY4,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,1,3,2008-04-29,"May have been a prequel to ""The Matrix""....","Confessions abound, this wasn't a favorite film of mine upon the initial viewing.  As I sat down to watch it again, there was hesitancy behind my eyes, Rene Clair's work is groundbreaking in every sense of the word, but this 1931 classic just seemed to be repetitive and predictable.  Finishing it a second time (and looking forward to my third), I must admit that I still didn't jump out of my chair with glee, but I did begin to see the resilient value in this classic.  Clair's ""A Nous La Liberte"" is not perfect, it is hard to find a film from this era that is, but it survives because of the emphasis on the characters and the honesty of the society.  It is a film that remains true today, as our governing economy tries to decide to take jobs overseas, to release workers and replace with machines, or just automate - automate - automate.  Those last three words have become the battle cry for our corporate class.  Clair saw this in 1931, and being a big fan of Charlie Chaplin, created an off-beat, quiet comedy that packs big punches in symbolism and suave camera tactics.  For me, it still feels bland to watch, but it isn't difficult to watch because of how unique Clair's eye was and his continuing contributions to modern cinema.I know, I know, I know - it sounds like I am extremely back and forth about this little film.  Honestly, I am.  There are elements that this critic could jump out and down about, and there are other parts that could be completely missed.  Clair's story is of two prison friends who escape, only to discover that the real world isn't quite as different as the life within the bars.  What makes this an interesting dynamic between the two inmates is that one goes the way of the industry, while the other pursues a life of love and nature.  As Clair builds a life for the two individually, it is when they finally reconnect that the true hijinks and humor begin.  The weight of their escape is constantly looming behind them; while the other is only excited about being married to a woman he merely met a few days prior builds towards the ending climax which combines both wit and humorous insight into a futuristic world that doesn't seem too ""futuristic"" now.  Where Clair succeeds is in developing the characters of both Emile and Louis into their respective roles and ideals while building these visual sets that give us a goofy view of capitalism.  He also adds more sugar to the pot by creatively using the camera, keeping our attention by sharp edits and scene transitions that work, but are extremely unexpected.  Clair should be applauded for bringing this subject to the screen, but again, he - nor this film - is perfect.  There are some struggles with this film such as music and time that detract from the realism of Clair's vision.  His choice of music does become repetitive and annoying throughout the film.  There were also moments where the music didn't seem to coexist well with the scene, demonstrating the truth that music doesn't fill all voids.  Then there is time.  Clair doesn't seem to care at all that to build a business like the record company of this film, years and years would have to pass.  That didn't happen at all.  With the simple growth of a mustache and the addition of glasses, we were only to assume that time had passed.  Clair did not address age or time, perhaps because he was trying to demonstrate the universality of this film, but it would have helped with the continuity overall.The development of the idea of man vs. machine, as well as the connectors that Clair uses to compare life in prison vs. life in the blue-collar world is strong.  In fact, these are probably the most valued points of this film.  Humor can be found with Clair's idea that once the machines are built, the workers only tasks are to play solitaire or go fishing, where as before they were brainwashed from youth that there is nothing more in life than work and sleep.  Living in 2008, this blue-collar world created by Clair is still relevant in the world.  In fact, today it is stronger as the theory of the missing middle class becomes more and more relevant.  Clair also dabbles with the thought that wealth, power, and inanimate objects only bring trouble and disaster, while having merely a few coins in your pocket will keep your friends closer.  It was these smaller issues that kept this film from mediocrity.  There should be more, I know, but as I think about this film, there just is little I love about this film.  I like this film quite a bit, but love would be too strong of a word.Overall, Rene Clair is a genius.  His films should be studied, watched, discussed, and further enjoyed.  There is no question that Clair's vision was unique and obviously loved as Charlie Chaplain borrowed some of his ideas from ""A Nous la Liberte"" for his masterpiece ""Modern Times"".  When watched with friends, conversation went from socialism to communism, from man to machine, from the basis for our class structure today in America.  In other words, this film opens the door to discussion about our lives, even today - but I cannot stand here and say that I loved this movie.  Criterion has done a phenomenal job of transferring Clair's image and sound, along with some interesting supplemental features about his life and the Chaplain controversy - but watching it a third time might prove challenging.  The humor was strong, the symbolism was present, but there is just something about films from this era (the 1930s) that just feel overplayed.  The music was an element I struggled with, constantly reusing the same notes over and over and misplacing them throughout the film.  The second was the concept of time - Clair seemed to forget that giving someone a mustache doesn't mean they have aged.  A strengthening of these small details would have created a film I could stand behind forever.  Alas, I cannot with this film.  I will suggest it to friends, but not stick around for the viewing.  Clair, I love your eyes, but ""A Nous la Liberte"" is not a favorite in my book.Grade: **** out of *****",4.0,0.3333333333333333,3,1,0.0,neutral,0.9993,very positive,2008,4,29

Not that this means that the legions of fans will be bitterly disappointed by the film version, but rather that there will be regrets over not getting to see favorite scenes on the screen.  For example, Quidditch is completely out of the film, denying Ron of his best moments in the sun (start singing ""Weasley is our king"").  So do not be surprised when your mind keeps shifting to what has been cut and distracting you from time to time while watching this summer's latest blockbuster.When last we left our hero, Harry fell victim to a trap to bring back Lord Voldermort, which cost Cedric Diggory his life.  The Ministry of Magic wants things hushed up, but Dumbledore tells the students at Hogwarts that Diggory was murdered and Lord Voldermort murdered him.  As this fifth film opens Harry and his wicked cousin Dudley are attacked by Dementors.  Harry uses his wand to defend them and is summarily expelled from Hogwarts for using magic in front of a muggle.  The good news is that Harry gets reinstated, but the bad news is that the Ministry of Magic uses the opportunity to appoint Dolores Umbridge,  Senior Undersecretary at the Ministry, as the school's new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.  However, Umbridge teaches only the theory and not the practice because she insists Harry is a liar and there is nothing the students need to learn to defend themselves from.  Then things get progressively worse.""The Order of the Phoenix"" was the most maddening book to read, not because it was the longest, but because I detest Dolores Umbridge.  As far as I am concerned she makes Voldermort look good, because he knows he is evil, wicked, bad, mean and nasty inside, while Umbridge thinks the ends justify the means.  She is puritanical, sadistic and hypocritical.  If there were not going to be children reading this review I would tell you what I really think of her.  Suffice it to say, she makes me sick and I do not even take pleasure in loving to hate her, which is why my only requirement going into the film is that the Weasley Twins get their moment of glory when they become the disloyal opposition to the new order at Hogwarts.Daniel Radcliffe continues to have the tote the heavy load in these films as Harry, with Rupert Grint's Ron Weasley being reduced more and more often to reaction shots while Emma Watson's Hermione Granger remains the Mistress of Exposition in these films.  Alan Rickman as Snape remains pitch perfect casting and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black is also a joy to watch, but I discovered in this film that I really like Michael Gambon's performance as Dumbledore, mainly because he always plays up the character's intelligence and I find I prefer his interpretation to that of the late Richard Harris, forgive my heresy.  Imelda Staunton does not look as much like a toad as Umbridge does in the book, but she captures the character's detestability from start to finish.  We are always painfully aware how dangerous she is, whether she smiles or not.  Also, Evanna Lynch steals more scenes as Luna Lovegood than Katie Leung does as Cho Chang, and it is certainly interesting to see Neville (Matthew Lewis) towering over everybody, with Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) in the silent but strong role for the pivotal sextet.After seeing this film I raced home and got out my copy of thebookand starting cataloguing things that had been cut.  Such comparisons are, as I suggested up top, inevitable for anyone who has read the book.  At this point what I missed the most were some of the conversations between Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagall and Umbridge where Minerva verbally flaws the Inquisitor.  The omission that I am focusing on the most is the whole bit about why Neville's family was a target of Voldermort (I agree with Harry: always say his name and thereby reduce its power), since that suggests implications for what will happen in thefinal book, which gets released in just ten more days.  I also would have liked to have seen an over reaction to Harry discovering his father bullied Snape at Hogwarts.  My favorite part ends up being the impressive wizard's duel between Voldermort and Dumbledore.  Screenwriter Michael Goldenberg does a good job of whittling down Rowling's book and director David Yates does a competent job, but fans will simply want more.  Also, we know what happens in the next book and all of the bad things that happen in this film cannot help but seem inconsequential in comparison.  Plus, fans will be distracted by mining this film for clues as to what will happen in the last book.",4.0,0.858433734939759,10,2,0.0,neutral,-0.9859,very negative,2007,7,11

The supporting characters were colorful enough to appeal to the kids and a lot of fun, characters like Davey Cricket, Beepin' Tom (from the Planet Saturnin'), Careless the Mexican Hairless, Buffalo Billy, Pop Gun (a takeoff on wild west characters brought to life by actor Walter Brennan) and my favorite, Li'l Ace from Outer Space, a mouse always on a space mission that fails...oh, and let's not forget Hare-cules Hare, the Brainy Bunny, who speaks in Spike Jonesian inflections when drawing punctuation signs in midair and proves, with his brawny dad that it takes equal parts brawn and brain to get by.But that is what is wrong with this collection--you don't get to see many of the shorts that introduce these characters and more.

You can see why John Kricfalusi (""REN & STIMPY"") was brought in originally to revive the series.  Those who saw that revival did eventually get samples of the original series interspersed in the weekly airings, but the network and the company distributing the show did not understand the reasons why the characters were so interesting and funny.

In this film, he DOES NOT play the part of Leatherface again. Just FYI. He plays the role an elderly man in this film.)""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" is a sequel, but it does not require the viewer to see any of the other ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" movies to understand what's going on. The film ignores all the other sequels, and it is a direct sequel to the first movie only. The shows scenes from the the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre during the opening credits to catch up viewers who have never seen the first movie as to what is going on exactly.The story in this film takes place immediately following the events of the original film. After a shoot-out between the crazy and violent Sawyer family and the local sheriff, with the assistance of some local vigilantes who are just as crazy and violent as the Sawyers. After the shoot-out, one of the vigilantes, who's name is Gavin Miller, (played by David Born) kidnaps the infant daughter of a young woman who is apart of the Sawyer family. The infant's name is Edith Sawyer, and the mother's name is Loretta Sawyer. (Dodie Brown) Miller takes Edith home with him, and he and his wife Arlene (Sue Rock) raise the child as if she was their own. They even change Edith's name to Heather.Heather and her new parents soon leave Texas for Oklahoma, and after Heather grows up, she has a fall-out with her Mom and Dad around Halloween, and discovers that her long-lost Grandmother from Texas, Verna Carson (who is played by Marilyn Burns who also played ""Sally"" in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre) passed away recently. Now Heather, along with the help of her friends, go on a road trip to Texas to find Heather's past. They soon cross paths with the infamous Leatherface (Dan Yeager) - A large, deformed, and deranged serial killer who for the most part uses a chainsaw to kill his victims, and wear's different victims faces as masks.When Heather returns to her hometown, her presence does not go unnoticed by Mayor Burt Hartman, (Paul Rae) who was one of the men involved in the shoot out with the Sawyer family decades earlier. When he learns of the recent sightings of Leatherface, Hartman opts to round up his old posse to finish the job they started when they first encountered the Sawyer's.""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" reminded me of ""The Devil's Rejects"" (Which is interesting since writer/director of ""The Devil's Rejects"" Rob Zombie was inspired by the original ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"". It's worth also nothing that Bill Mosely was in both ""The Devil's Rejects"" and ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"".) The reason why I feel both stories are a little bit alike is because both involve one psycho, redneck, no nonsense family taking on another psycho, redneck, no-nonsense family. The feud reminds me a lot of the feud between the Hatfield's and the McCoy's.As I watched ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"", I honestly had trouble figuring out who I was suppose to be more scared of, but that is where a major appeal for me comes into play. Some films, such as one, are not about telling you how to think - They are about telling you to think for yourself.The pacing of the film is wonderful and there was never a slow moment. The film is bound to scare anyone who has never seen a horror film before or just doesn't watch much of them. Horror-watching vets will be entertained as well. Finally, I enjoyed the 3-D too and I think it's cool that a whole new generation gets to enjoy 3-D. The film has plenty of ""jump out and scare you"" moments, as well as tons of gore.This movie makes for a great action film too, and reminds me of a modern-day Western with the way the two families are feuding with each other. There are also plenty of homages made through out movie to the old-school Texas Chainsaw Massacre film.I thought the film was highly entertaining. After six ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" movies, I was concerned that the new film was going to be the ""same old, same old"" but it wasn't.

I think the price has finally dropped on this version as the blu ray must be due out soon.  There were many episodes I missed. Now that I have binge watched the whole thing, I think it is a shame they did not get to the Romulan war as season 5 or a follow on movie. Not popular enough for that at all, everyone already tuned out by the time this series turned the corner.  Many, many weak episodes straying from the &#34;canonical&#34; trek history or approach. There was a lot more dark side in this series, I think than any other. It shows the growing pains that were needed to get to the essentially optimistic original Trek Series federation future.This series has the best engineer of all engineers  (sorry Scotty) in Charles Tucker. It spotlights how the help of a good wrench is worth more than a thousand diplomatic words when you are stalled in space, (or stuck in a tight battle). Season 3 is a long grind through the darkness with many twists and turns resolving the temporal cold war, something never mentioned in any other Trek series.  Season 4 is by far the best set of episodes without the constant long mission focus of season 3. It attempts to resolve a lot of historical questions never otherwise addressed, like smooth brow Klingons, and largely done successfully. Some excellent episodes in Season 3 and 4. Horrible contrived and evil final ending episode that was basically a big resentful dog dropping onto the franchise and the fans.

1008704,B000H0MKO2,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0,1,2006-04-01,Reitman and an Inspired Cast Produce a Dagger-Driven Satire Full of Well-Earned Laughs,"Aaron Eckhart made his first vivid big-screen impression as the misogynistic Chad in Neil LaBute's scathing 1997 ""In the Company of Men"". Since then, he has been waffling in leading man roles, but luckily, he comes back to form as the appropriately named Nick Naylor, tobacco industry lobbyist extraordinaire, in first-time director/writer Jason Reitman's wonderfully acerbic comedy about the power of media spin around the availability of cigarettes despite inescapable evidence that smoking kills. The film's perspective is ruthlessly cynical and most of the characters morally ambiguous, but those are the primary reasons why this movie sizzles full of shrewd insights about political gamesmanship in both the public and private sectors. The zigzag plot follows Nick from the bogus, cigarette company-funded Academy of Tobacco Studies to the pretentiously Zen office of an equally pretentious Hollywood Studio mogul to a dicey encounter with a former Marlboro man to the welcoming arms of an ambitious reporter. The unpredictable journey provides Reitman an opportunity for both broad, whack-a-mole comedy to piercing, observant zingers that resonate with the truths they expose.Reitman has recruited a first-class cast to bring his brittle satire to life starting with a superb turn by Eckhart, who alternates easily between unapologetically smug and begrudgingly likable. At their favorite watering hole, Nick's two lobbyist buddies are played with barbed precision by David Koechner as the Bush-sound-alike firearms specialist and especially the wondrous Maria Bello as the sharp-tongued alcohol representative. There are also inspired turns from very unlikely sources with Rob Lowe hilarious as Jeff Megall, the honey-voiced, Asia-obsessed mogul; Sam Elliott defiantly cagey as the Marlboro Man; and even Katie Holmes surprisingly convincing as Heather Holloway, the morally bankrupt reporter who appears to be Nick's kindred spirit. Scene stealing is quite democratic with clever turns by Robert Duvall as the tobacco kingpin; William H. Macy as the unctuous, anti-tobacco senator from Vermont looking to put a skull-and-crossbones logo on all packs of cigarettes; J.K. Simmons as Nick's immoral boss BR; and a very funny Adam Brody as Megall's obnoxious assistant.Beginning with the inventive artwork of the opening credits, the plot goes in unexpected directions, and while the ending is a bit soft, the overall movie more than satisfies. In fact, I doubt if I have laughed harder in a movie theater since last year's ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"", but the smart, provocative barbs really make you think about the persistent hypocrisy of big business and government in refreshing ways that are not remotely disdainful to the audience. Even the comparatively soft-centered scenes of Nick with his son have a nice edge, and with his translucent blue eyes, Cameron Bright strikes the right, non-judgmental notes as Joey. Reitman seems fully capable of bringing an acidic flavor to the most Capra-esque situation. This one is highly recommended.",4.0,0.0,5,3,0.7506,very positive,0.9968,very positive,2006,4,1
642766,B00005JOSG,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,3,3,2006-05-04,"""You mean I'm really going to die!""","Famed movie critics roger Ebert and Richard Roeper said that in Last Holiday Queen Latifa has finally got the role she has been waiting for. To a certain extent, they are right. Although Last Holiday is full of contrivances and week plot points, the film is an absolute showcase for the lovely Latifa, and really does illustrate her at her very best.Directed by Wayne Wang, the film is also a lovely and sensitive homage to good food, fine wine, and making sure you get the most out of life. Queen Latifa plays Georgia Byrd, a clerk cookware in Kragen's department store in New Orleans. She likes to cook exotic meals but only eats Lean Cuisine.She's a reserved and rather timid woman and who is in love with a fellow clerk, hunky Sean Matthews (LL Cool J), but is too shy to connect with him. Her sales are the highest, she's the most beloved staff member, the most organized, professional and humane, and of course the least recognized.Bad news comes in the form of a death sentence when a routine CAT scan indicates she has only three weeks left to live. Upset, but determined to remake her life, she quits her job - much to the chagrin of her priggish boss - cashes in her stocks and IRA and flies to the Czech Republic, actually to the ski-and-spa town of Karlovy Vary. Amidst the splendors of this snow covered, old world resort, she bathes herself in luxury and mingles with the rich habitu?s of such a milieu.She befriends a group of rich congressmen including the vacationing Louisiana senator (Giancarlo Esposito), an evil retail magnate (Timothy Hutton) and his adoring mistress (Alicia Witt). Everyone begins to believe that she's a ""somebody."" She also connects with hotel chef (Gerard Depardieu). It seems as though impending death as liberated her with everyone at the hotel, staff and guests falling in love with her as she blossoms with charisma, wisdom, proficiency, courage and grace.The plot is predictable, and the ending comes as no surprise, but the charm of the film is Queen Latifa's winning performance as Georgia. She has a calm beauty and a kind of charming harmony that manages to inspire and rise about the somewhat trite and sentimental material. Along the way the movie attempts to make comments about the evils of corporate greed, the political corruption and there's a kind of average expression of human decency.Last Holiday is never either terribly funny or terribly dramatic, but Latifa's quiet solidity and the fact that she plays such an ordinary person faced with such extraordinary circumstances make us root for the film in ways that larger, louder pictures never manage to achieve.

It's a series that a lot of people  wanted to hate (including me, since I grew up watching the 1987 animated series)...but fortunately, it's a ton of fun and probably the best TMNT series to date, even after just a few dozen episodes. The terrific action, humor, new characters and cinematic feel are easy standouts, as well as the voice acting and nods to the 1987 series.  Unlike ""Rise of the Turtles"" and ""Enter Shredder"" (the first two Season One ""volume"" releases), this doubles the episode count on two discs for only about $5 more.  I'd have given it five stars for the fun factor, but Nickelodeon's continued practice of avoiding season sets  is just irritating.  With any luck, we'll get a complete Season One release---and hopefully on Blu-ray---in the near future.Other than that mild annoyance, ""Ultimate Showdown"" is unquestionably worth buying.  These 12 episodes feel bigger in scope and execution than Season One's first half, answering plenty of questions without filling in all the blanks.  If you're new to this 2012 series, start with ""Rise of the Turtles"" first...but if you're like me, it won't take you long to get caught up.

No longer just a quaint little tale from a distant past, the story, with its themes of unbridled greed and compassion for the poor, speaks with a renewed urgency to our current generation.So, polemics aside, how does the 2009 ""motion-capture"" animated version of this most famous of all stories stack up against the umpteen others we've seen over the course of a lifetime (including those featuring The Muppets and Mr Magoo)?  Very well, actually.  Robert Zemechis' movie remains generally faithful to the source material, and, while it provides us with a visually ravishing - almost snow globe-like - look at a wintry 19th Century London, it isn't afraid to confront the darker elements of the tale as well (as such, it might be a bit frightening for very young kids at times).  And while one could accuse it of going a trifle overboard in its search for the requisite 3-D sensation (as most of these films by their very nature are wont to do), the movie remains forever focused on the human heart that beats at the core of the work.Even in semi-animated form, Jim Carrey is so remarkable as the miser Scrooge (and the three main ghosts who visit him) that, in the spirit of the holidays, we're even willing to forgive him for his desecration of the Grinch a decade or so back.  And he's backed by a first-class cast that includes Robin Wright Penn, Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Bob Hoskins, and Cary Elwes among others.All minor quibbles and qualms aside, you'd have to be a bah-humbugging Scrooge yourself to resist the charms of this movie.",4.0,0.25,14,3,0.4404,positive,0.9139,very positive,2011,12,22

The movie is a succulent exercise in whimsy, the sort of uncoordinated, calm craziness of early adolescence in the case of a 14-year old boy left alone at home, with a pal of his own age, whom soon a more knowing girl of 16 joins, the lass being a bit of a flirt. Also participating in the ensuing revels is a 30-something slacker with a &#34;McJob&#34; delivering pizza, including to the two boys (with whom he ends up passing the day) on this dull Sunday afternoon, off-and-on with and without electrical power for the computer games that they so favour. The title derives from a painting and various duck-like objects that appear as a constant motif in the film.Amazon-U.S. has several good reviews of this little cinematic charmer, so there is no need here to go into any considerable detail. The film is an exercise in whimsy, its fey charm lying in the depiction of the sweetly unaffected innocence of early puberty, of youth still without responsibility or more advanced sexual awakening, for the three teens, and of the frustrations of &#34;slackerhood&#34; for the hapless young man. Its &#34;R&#34; rating (for &#34;restricted&#34;) is rather silly, due only to some mild profanity now and then from boys trying to exhibit how &#34;cool&#34; they are and for the deftly cute portrayal of how marijuana (in birthday brownies that the girl makes after a failed cake) affects the foursome's perceptions, pretty innocent stuff in terms of modern film-making!One definitely should see it in this edition with English (or other) subtitles, unless the viewer's Spanish is good enough to catch banter, including slang, which the characters deliver often quite offhandedly, otherwise one is likely to miss the sly humour of what makes this low-key movie so endearing.

Nathaniel West's novel is an original meld of sardonic satire and touching emotional realism about working stiffs in Hollywood of the Depression era.  Various men revolve around the orbit of a beautiful but empty minor starlet, superbly brought to life by Karen Black.  The social realism is gritty, buoyed by the surreal atmosphere of Hollywood fakery and weirdness.  It all works toward an apocalyptic conclusion, as the social chaos of the era, just barely under the surface, erupts in the finale.The film is extremely well directed, superbly photographed, has a first rate period sountrack, and several fine performances.  But West's tightrope act on the written page is uncannily resistant to replication, apparently.  The film's end, while generally faithful to the book, edges too far into surrealism and leaves one wondering what happened to one of the main characters, Todd.  The end of the novel, to the contrary, is hard edged realism.  The film is such a first rate slice of life, however, that it is not wholly spoiled.  Well worth seeing and seeing again, it conveys the unique genius of West's vision -- both lighter and darker, in varying aspects, than the older F.

As she tells this story to the interviewer and his cameraman, it is interspersed with scenes from her films in which she is always seeking reunion with an absent lover.  To add yet another layer, the interviewer himself has always harbored a secret passion for the actress and appears as her protector in many of these scenes.This fascinating movie produces an effect that is difficult to put into words.  The inclusion of so many film scenes in lieu of flashbacks elevates Chiyoko's story above the particular circumstances of a single human life, giving it the iconic power inherent in great films, so that it seems that she suffers and loves on behalf of us all.

Eaten Alive is probably what Psycho would have been if Hooper had beaten Hitchcock to the punch.  This movie is so similar to TCM(that's Texas Chainsaw Massacre, not Turner Classic Movies) in terms of look, feel, soundtrack, and even some of the actors, that it's almost an unofficial sequel.  But though the style is the same, that doesn't mean we're dealing with a film as good as TCM, but in Hooper's defense, that's a hard act to top.  This film also has an Argento touch, with many of the scenes bathed in red and blue light.  It's also got the TCM grainy look, but a little more slick.The story is rather simple.  A lunatic named Judd runs a grimy hotel, and he has a thing for killing his tenants with a scythe and throwing them to his pet gator.  That's about it.I'm surprised anyone would stop at this place considering how yucky it looks, and Judd makes no attempt to even act normal to anyone.  The scariest thing here is a brief appearance by William Finley, who as any normal American would know, played The Phantom Of The Paradise.  He shows up with his wife and kid, and acts so friggin' nuts that he comes across as more dangerous than Judd.  Finley's wife is played by none other than TCM's Marilyn Burns.  Basically she's reprising her role from that film as she is beaten, bound, and terrorized.  And yes, she screams a lot too.Hooper gives us a bit of sex and nudity here, most of these scenes involving a young Robert Englund as a scumbag named Buck, a guy who likes to.......play pool.Neville Brand is a decent psycho.  He looks like a bespectacled neanderthal man who's constantly mumbling and ranting nonsense.  I still think Finley was creepier.The gator is nothing to brag about, but I have a thing for fake looking gators.Needless to say, this film is not for everyone.  The grimy, trippy 70s style will put off modern filmgoers, but it creates a unique atmosphere that films just don't have anymore.  Plus it's full of trademark oddball Hooper characters and not the best acting in the world.  Nor is it action packed.

Though she sings I Turn To You horribly on here, the other hits sound pretty good. I wish someone would tell her that her live singing is atrocious these days. Have you heard her attempting to sing Fighter live? Geesh. The Christmas songs on here aren't even worth looking at. It's pathedic, except maybe the last one called Christmas Time. And she has destroyed one of my favorite songs, Climb Every Mountain. Why oh why? My summary is that she sings most of her hits well but the holiday stuff and the covers are extremely boring and extremely don't-waste-my-time-like. At least she's wearing clothes which is something that her street walker mentality these days fails to contemplate.

972671,B000EHQ7HY,A328S9RN3U5M68,9,9,2006-05-30,Crossroads: Enter the Corporate World Versus Enter the World of Living,"Kevin Noland makes a fine debut in both writing and directing this colorful, insightful, low-key exploration of the age old Apollonian Dionysian conflict.  For a first film, despite some minor technical glitches (overexposed photography at key moments, a soundtrack that eats the dialogue before it is audible), Noland proves himself a keen observer of life, of philosophy, and of character studies.  He is definitely an artist to watch.Chris McKinley (Joshua Jackson in yet another fine performance) has just finished college and is ending his summer holiday in Spain with only three days before he returns to an important corporate position in the US. He is traveling with two friends, Ryan (Timm Sharp) and Michelle (Ruthanna Hopper) who are lovers, and they end their holiday in Pamplona, Spain just as the festival of the bulls is happening. Chris' backpack is stolen and with it his passport, credit cards, all semblances of civilization..., and he plunges out of despair into the wildness of the running of the bulls.  He meets two important influences: American expatriate bar owner Riccardo who spouts forth 'live for the moment' concepts, and the beautiful and intoxicating  Adela (Leonor Varela) who embodies all that is fascinating about the beauty of Spain.  The four young people set out on a hike to fly fish, carouse, and live with nature, and this excursion into Spain's gorgeous countryside affects the foursome: Ryan and Michelle decide to part ways and Chris and Adela...well, the story has a fine ending!Noland respects the viewer and offers his tale of discovery with minimal dialogue, some terrific music, exciting footage of the running of the bulls and bullfights, and some hallucinogenic views of nature.  Both Joshua Jackson and Leonor Varela light up the screen.  Ruthanna Hopper (Dennis Hopper's daughter) not only acts well, she also has been part of this project since its inception, is one of the producers, and adds a credibility to the story.  So despite the occasional technical flaws, this is a little film of joy, a celebration of discovery the important facts of living.

1152214,B001662FKK,A18G7GG53G2X8A,21,26,2008-02-26,Do Not Attempt to Adjust Your Set--We Are in Control,"""The Signal"" is the work of natural independent filmmakers, and it shows because they focus on actual storytelling instead of unimportant details. You watch it without analyzing anything--you just let the story happen, and you take it for almost everything it's worth. The surprising thing is that it achieves all this despite being a supernatural thriller, a genre notorious for trying to explain everything; here's a story that explains virtually nothing yet still manages to be both understandable and frightening. The basic idea seems unnerving enough, if a little too reminiscent of Stephen King's ""Cell"": in the fictional city of Terminus (whose very name must be symbolic), a signal sent through television sets on New Year's Eve makes anyone watching it irrational, paranoid, psychotic, and homicidal. This signal, wherever it came from, distorts perceptions of reality and makes the victim see things that aren't there and understand things that make no sense. As a result, people kill each other left and right for no apparent reason. They have The Crazy in their heads.In the midst of this chaos are three main characters caught in a bizarre love triangle, and this is fitting since the film is divided into three distinct sections, or in this case, transmissions. The first, called ""Crazy in Love,"" introduces us to Mya (Anessa Ramsey) and Ben (Justin Welborn), who are secretly having an affair. Ben awakens in the middle of the night and notices his TV, which he thought had been turned off; not only is it on, the screen shows nothing but patterned white static, as well. Then Mya awakens, and when she realizes what time it is, she hurriedly dresses and heads for home. She knows something's wrong as soon as she enters the building because almost everyone is awake, and they argue with one another as they wander the halls. When she enters her apartment, she first sees two of her husband's friends struggling to fix the TV's reception (they want to watch the baseball game). She then faces her husband, Lewis (AJ Brown), and at that point, we immediately know two things: (1) Lewis has already been affected by the signal; (2) his need to domineer was amplified--but not created--by the signal.The second transmission is called ""The Jealously Monster,"" and it's the weakest because it relies on quirky comedy instead of subtler moments of satire. This is when we meet Anna (Cheri Christian), and we immediately see that she has killed her husband. We also see that she's disappointed over not being able to throw a New Year's Eve party; as her husband's body sits across from her, she tells him that, when the guests arrive, she'll just tell them to leave. Her neighbor, Clark (Scott Poythress), stops by before long, as does Lewis, who uses his profession as an exterminator as an excuse to enter. Lewis is now on a mission to recapture his wife, a mission so obsessive that he doesn't trust anyone. He also sees Mya in place of Anna and kills almost anyone who comes near her. Even when he realizes who's who, he remains convinced that Anna knows where Mya has gone. He also has a powerful influence over Clark, who shifts between understanding the signal and being its unwilling pawn.The third segment is called ""Escape from Terminus,"" and if you think that title gives away the ending, you've got another thing coming. This segment wisely veers away from intentional humor, focusing once again on the desperate situation the characters are in. There are two notable exceptions, and while I won't describe them in detail, I will say that one involves aluminum foil and the other involves a severed head. By now, Clark and Ben are trying to intercept Mya before Lewis can, which will be difficult since all three men have been affected by the signal to a certain degree. It's really a question of will power, of knowing what to focus on and how to push irrational thoughts aside. Clark and Ben theorize that the signal is a kind of programmer, sending messages that trick the brain into believing what it shouldn't believe. It's pretty likely that this is a social commentary on television in general. Let's look at the obvious example of reality shows: they influence viewers into a primal state of competition, encouraging votes for the best singer, or the best dancer, or the best model.It's also pretty likely that the film is a commentary on the state of humanity in general. Consider the fact that it opens with footage of a schlocky exploitation film, much like Wes Craven's ""Last House on the Left"": we slowly begin to realize that the needless violence of that footage is being echoed in the plot of ""The Signal,"" with numerous, brutal murders that are justified only in the minds of the Crazies. The only way this film departs from films like ""Last House on the Left"" is that it focuses more on the aftermath than on the actual killing. Yes, violent deaths are featured, but we see more spilt blood than blood being spilt, if you get my drift. I suspect that the three writers and directors--David Bruckner, Dan Bush, and Jacob Gentry--did this on purpose, which is fine by me; lingering shots of blood and gore may be fun to look at, but they don't really add much as far as the story is concerned. But story is exactly what ""The Signal"" focuses on, making for one of the more original thrillers of recent memory. Instead of going for obvious, cheap thrills, it's ambitious enough to be unnerving and unpredictable. That's exactly the way a supernatural thriller should be, even with the occasional lapse into unnecessary comedy.",4.0,0.8076923076923077,7,1,0.0,neutral,-0.9744,very negative,2008,2,26

He's the order's Sherlock Holmes, and they certainly need one. Monks are dropping like flies, in the most horrible ways. But then many of the monks are pretty horrible themselves. This is a very dark drama. There are a few light moments, but only a few.But the mystery really is baffling, as it was in the book by Umberto Eco on which it was based. In fact, as I recall, there is a basic faith with the book. I read it many years before I first saw the movie, and that was itself many years ago, when it was in theaters. The politics of the day, including the church politics, is intimately tied to the mystery, but more than that I will not say without ruining it for you. One small clue: the monastery is one that houses a fairly impressive library, including some forbidden works. Makes me think of the restricted section at the Hogwarts library, as a matter of fact.If you don't like old stories that accurately portray how grimy people were in those days, even monks, then perhaps this will offend you. But get past that hang-up, and the amount of blood involved in the murders, and you have a story of intrigue and yes, even lust, that is really quite engrossing.Four stars, although one is just for Sean Connery personally, and that totally sexy voice of his.",4.0,1.0,4,1,0.0,neutral,-0.1575,neutral,2012,5,21

I was mistaken.  It's actually an entertaining romp that is mostly eye candy but does have some interesting acting in it.  The somewhat goofy premise is as follows:Long ago, a human was born whose body was able to rapidly alter itself to resist environmental conditions.  This allowed him to survive a plague that destroyed his village.  His children inherited that trait.  One was bitten by a bat and spawned a race of vampires, while another was bitten by a wolf and spawned a race of werewolves (a.k.a. lycans).  A third did neither and hence the trait also survived in 'normal' humans.  This divergence of races was long ago forgotten, and vampires and werewolves are now at one another's throats (har har) over a millenia of real and imagined slights.  Kate Beckinsale plays a melodramatically-named 'Death Dealer', a vampire devoted to fighting lycans, who falls in love with a lycan candidate.  Unbeknownst to all but a few tricky lycans, that candidate is a descendent of the 'human' strain of the original sire of all three races, and has the potential to become a hybrid vampire/lycan.  Much mayhem and throat biting commences.Now, it's pretty obvious from the get-go that logic needs to get chucked out the window.  Similarly, there's about as many sparks flying between Beckinsale and her love interest as there is between the mayonnaise and bologna in a bad deli sandwich.  However the film does a surprisingly, almost effort-savingly good job of representing the various packs of night critters involved.  The lycans impressively shape shift into massive, combat-oriented werewolves whenever angered (quite similar to another underappreciated recent film, 'Dog Soldiers'), and while the vampires don't do a lot of typically vampiric things like mind control or turning into packs of rats, they at least manage the 'gaunt and world-weary' thing well.  You also get a sense of the hide-bound nature of their world, which is based on the endless rule of centuries-old elders and ancients, with newer vampires stuck in an immortality bereft of change or advancement.  There are some great action sequences, a lot of fine back stabbing, and generally a great deal of enthusiasm on all sides when the fur starts flying.  It really is almost enough to make up for the paper-thin plot and makes for a perfect summer movie..grab some popcorn and just enjoy the ride.On a side note, the general plot and themes seem to have been basically lifted wholesale from an entire book/RPG system of vampires v. werewolves that has been published by White Wolf for decades, to such an extent that I thought White Wolf had sponsored the film.  Apparently not, given the fact they're suing over it (see the 'quotes and trivia' link in the product description above).  If you've ever heard of them, you may be interested in this film as well.",4.0,0.6,1,5,0.4404,positive,0.9954,very positive,2004,1,30
494961,B000007PAD,A1F2IPYSXB0ZCX,18,20,2006-07-26,The Spooky But Definitive Live-Action Version Of Alice In Wonderland,"The wonderful Victorian classic, Alice's Adventures In Wonderland was very first published in 1865. Written by acclaimed author, Lewis Carroll (real name - Charles Dodgson), this fantasy-adventure story has been adapted to the stage and screen countless times.There's the familiar, misreably underated Walt Disney animated classic of Alice In Wonderland whilst there are a listless number of live-action adaptations that have largely failed to truly capture the spirit and flavour of Lewis Carrolls vivid vision of Wonderland.This 1972 adptation is something of an exception and stands out as the best live-action version of the book. Director William Sterling, shrewdly manages to encapsulate the dark, frightening vision of Wonderland as dreamed up by Lewis Carroll.Fiona Fullerton heads the cast making a pleasantly bland Alice. What Fullerton succeeds in doing is taking with you with her on a magical journey, allowing you to view the strange adventures through her eyes, evoking a feeling ofbeing drawn into a childs dream that escalates into a nightmare.Fiona Fullerton is not least given noble support from a stellar cast that were some of the best of that era. The multi-talented Michael Crawford assumes the role of the jittering White Rabbit. Crawford playes the White Rabbit with a certain flair, relying mostly (and appropriately) on his inimitable comic skills.Sir Robert Helpmann (who is more well known for his famous role as the child catcher in another excellent classic childrens movie, Chitty,Chitty, Bang, Bang) shines as the notorious Mad Hatter during the manic Mad Hatter's tea party sequence. Helpmann's comic facial expressions andspirited playing makes the sequence work extremely well. Helpmann shares the spotlight in this madcap scene with Peter Sellers who gives a fine supporting turn as the March Hare whilst Dudley Moore causes some amusement as the poor, put-upon Dormouse.Sir Ralph Richardson delivers a fairly adequate performance as the Catepillar in a very vivid scene whilst Davy Kaye as the Mouse during the dreamy Caucus Race Sequence, playes the role with a degree of subtelty. Much more effective though is Dame Flora Robson, putting in a fantastic intepretation of the ferocious Queen Of Heartswho is both comical and scary in the role.Michael Jayston appears in the opening scene as Dodgson (Jayston) and Duckworth (Hywel Bennett)sit on a river bank one hot summers afternoon. It is here where Dodgson begins telling Alice the story of Alice's adventures underground.The nightmarish Duchess and Cook sequence is ignited by a fittingly off-beat performance from Peter Bull as the Duchess. Patsy Rolands as the demented, pepper-loving, plate-throwing Cook takes this role to fabulous new heights!The sullen, ever-crying Gryphon is played marvelously by Spike Milligan whilst Michael Hordern is equally excellent as the Mock Turtle. This fun sequence where Alice, the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle are seen running and dancingtheir way round a deserted beach, is speeded up at points to add to its comical and magical effect. This scene is also accompanied by one of the very few effective songs of the saccharine soundtrack, Will You, Won't You Join The Dance?Roy Kinnear is fabulous as the permanently grinning Cheshire Cat whilst other notable players in the more than capable cast include Dennis Price in a small but efficent role as the King Of Hearts, Rodney Bewes as the bumblingKnave Of Hearts, Julian Chagrin as Bill The Lizard (seen during the scene where Alice has grown large and is stuck in the White Rabbit's house - Bill the Lizard attempts to slide down the chimney into the house but Alice then swiftly kicks him back up again), Freddie Earlle as Guinea Pig Pat (also seen during the White Rabbit's house scene), Ray Brooks as 1 of Spades, Dennis Waterman as 2 of spades and of course not forgetting twin brothers Frank and Freddie Cox who make the definitive Tweedledee and Tweedledum (characters that were taken from a segment inLewis Carroll's sequel, Through The Looking Glass And What Alice Found There - most stage and screen versions often tend to draw large segments from both Alice books).Alice's Adventures In Wonderland (1972) draws on a somewhat dreamy, hazy-like effect that largely gives the film an intentionally dark, scary edge. It strikes an even balance between moments of fun, magical comedy to more frightening settings.Most of the film is engaging and totally enchanting. the surreal sequence at the beginning of the adventure is one of the scenes that really stands out in my mind as it is doen so effectively. Alice wakes up in a giant story bookgarden and spots the White Rabbit gazing at his waist watch. Alice proceeds to follow the White Rabbit into a long, dark tunnell. Keeping up with the whole familiar ethos of Alices In Wonderland's famous catchphrase, ""curiouser andcuriouser"", Alice continues following the White Rabbit unaware of the danger lying in front of her and then finds herself tumbling down a large rabbit hole which leads to the whimsical, topsy-turvy world of Wonderland. The score during this sequence is masterful and hauntinglyatmospheric.The Pool Of Tears sequence also works incredibly well where Alice finds herself in a large hall full of doors. A small door, to her delight, leads into a beautiful garden. It is here where she discovers potions and cakes that alternately make her shrink or grow large. At one point, Alice grows large and begins crying which subsequently leads to her shrinking and swimming in her own pool of tears.Alice is washed ashore from the pool of tears and finds herself indulging in the Caucus Race with a mouse, dodo, owl, magpie, frog, duck and an eagle in a vastly trippy sequence! I've heard (as i'm sure you all have) various myths that Lewis Carroll was high on LSD at the time of writing the book. I have no idea whether this is true or not but you certianly can see peoples notions on this when you watch all the bizarre goings on in Alice's Adventures In Wonderland. I put it all down to a bizarre but great imagination on Lewis Carroll's part and this film merely reflects that. Even so theres something that distinctley gives me the creeps when watching scenes such as The Pool Of Tears and the Caucus Race.Alice's Adventures In Wonderland (1972) is even more disturbingly surreal later on in the film such as the scene in the forest where a torrential storm occurs and a a giant black crow emerges from the gloomy sky ready to attack Alice.The Duchess and Cook sequence also used to really give me the creeps when I first watched this at 4 years old back in 1983. There was just something eerie and nightmarish about the whole scene but again this ties in closley with the book. The Trial of the Knave Of Hearts is where it gets most off the wall and at the close of this scenes there are lots of swirling, hallucegenic close-ups of the characters. Alice, of course, then wakes up on the riverbank to discover it was all just a dream.What compliments the mesmerising, hypnotic vibe of Alice's Adventures In Wonderland is a bewitching, hauntingly atmospheric score by BAFTA-winning, John Barry. The film also boasts maginificent cinematography from Geoffrey Unsworth which sticks closely to the original illustrations of the book. Some of the cardboard-like sets look far more suited for a stage production but many are eye catchingly beautiful.Alice's Adventures In Wonderland (1972) is an extremely faithful adaptation that's most noble in its loyalty to the book. In that fact it deserved far greater recognition than it has, perharps, received. Widely regarded as the best live-action screen version by lovers of the book, it was still unfairly slated by critics of the day where some claimed it was too long, tedious and boring. To a point I can see where they're coming from so you really have to be in the right mood to take this film on. On the right day it proves a thrilling, almost hypnotic viewing experience (even though i'm 26 years old!).In an attempt to ignite the films fortunes, Fiona Fullerton was being promoted as the new Julie Andrews (though Fullerton is a remarkable actress in her own right, this was something of an overstatement) but this did little to help the films fate. Making matters worse was Peter Sellers who blatantly criticised the film to the media before it had even opened at cinemas! Sadly Alice's Adventures In Wonderland did not endure the high Box Office turn over as anticipated.It's true that Alice's Adventures In Wonderland (1972) is too slow and bland at points but on casting its shortcomings (which you can over-look) aside, it's most definitely worth a look. Fans of Alice In Wonderland that have not yet had the delight of watching this charming, atmospheric version, will be thoroughly enthralled.Ian PhillipsJuly 2006",4.0,0.9,1,1,0.0,neutral,0.9983,very positive,2006,7,26
777219,B0000D9PNP,A1TDFF5G1KYE8T,1,1,2009-10-31,"Entertaining, but Also Discouraging","Project Greenlight season two was very entertaining, unlike the movie that resulted from it.  I think it is a wonderful idea, and applaud Ben And Matt for sponsoring it. Bottom line, the problem with the project results may be the frustrating process.What I believe from watching the DVDs was that Project Greenlight and Miramax need to choose the director(s) and then let him/her/them have a large part in selecting the script.  The group selecting the script now, including Ben and Matt, either do not know how to choose a good script, or have too much politics involved in the process.  After watching the comments on the scripts, you still have no idea what they will ultimately pick.In my opinion, the ""Battle of Shaker Heights"" was a lame story, and had no hope of making a profit regardless of who directed it, because there was nothing novel about it on top of being a very contrived (unrealistic) plot.  The casting process also was a political process driven by Miramax which seemed to almost force actors on the directors, but even great actors cannot fix a story that is not very interesting, funny, or believable.If the directors were chosen and given a large input into the script selection process, this could be a huge step forward in the quality of the project. I felt it was unfair for the directors to have to produce a script that really had nothing new to offer other than a showcase for the actor Shia.It somewhat killed my desire to compete in Project Greenlight again, but the support by Chris Moore and others gives great insight to the difficulties and challenges in making a low budget movie even with the best crew and equipment.  I hope they have more financial success in the future and let the directors have more input into the script in the future. The director does not have to be the writer, which may have been a season 3 mistake, but at least be in tune with the script chosen.",4.0,1.0,1,1,-0.4404,negative,0.9509,very positive,2009,10,31

1146519,B0014E29TQ,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,19,21,2008-07-26,HIT ME,"Films about gambling and Las Vegas in particular have always held a certain fascination with the public, culminating with perhaps the ultimate Vegas movie OCEAN'S ELEVEN. But this week we have a release of a film that takes the Vegas movie a whole new direction. Most stunning of all is that it is in part based on a true story.TWENTY ONE is the story of Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess), a struggling student at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) who has hopes of attending Harvard Med School. A grade A student with a 4.0 average, Ben is interviewed for a full ride scholarship. All he has to do is present an essay describing a life experience that sets him out above the other several hundred students applying. The problem is he has nearly no life experience.That all changes when he starts a class taught by Prof. Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey). During the class, Rosa notices Ben's aptitude with numbers and mathematical equations. In turn, he invites him to join a select group of students Rosa has put together. The reason? Using the technique of counting cards, they plan to make a mint in Vegas at the blackjack tables.At first hesitant to do so, Ben finally comes around and joins the group which consists of Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth), Choi (Aaron Yoo), Kianna (Liza Lapira) and Fisher (Jacob Pitts). The group learns to not only count cards, they put together a set of signals to let the lead player know which tables are hot and when to move on. When they have it down, they become Vegas bound.It runs like clockwork. The tables return them all a tidy profit and back to school they go, only to return weekend after weekend. Along the way a romance develops between Ben and Jill, Choi continues to pilfer tiny items everywhere he goes and Fisher places the entire project in jeopardy with a drunken night at the tables. The result is Fisher gets booted and Ben becomes the big cheese.With money coming in like never before, the rush of taking on the tables in Vegas and finding love at last, Ben's life changes but not for the better. Grades become a thing of the past as do his friends. His focus becomes making more and more money until he takes a chance he can't come back from.A bad night at the tables results in Micky cutting Ben lose and leaving the team in their hotel room alone. Making the decision to go it alone, Ben gets caught by Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne), the head of security for the hotel casino. Not only does he get caught, Cole has a grudge against an old gambler he lost years ago...named Micky Rosa.The twists and turns at the end of the film along with the build up from the start make this a compelling movie that holds your attention from the starting gate. Ben's life riding a roller coaster of lows, highs and a return to the lows makes for an interesting tale that turned out much better than I expected.All performances seen in this flick are totally believable from the leads to the secondary characters. While Spacey may have been the ""name above the title"" in getting this movie made, he doesn't take center stage here, instead opting to work with the ensemble and that is to the benefit of the film.Based on the true story of a group of MIT students who actually did take Vegas for a ton of money, though not nearly in the same way shown here for dramatic effect, the film is certain to get the hopes up of gamblers seeking a way to beat the bank. Don't get caught up in that notion as the house is always the favorite. Instead, get caught up in the tale of a group of students led by a charismatic teacher who take a gamble and end up getting more than they bargained for.",4.0,0.9047619047619048,5,1,0.0,neutral,0.9841,very positive,2008,7,26
85220,0788882988,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,4,5,2008-03-15,"Violent, Darkly Comic, and Entertaining. But Surprisingly Simplistic.","""No Country for Old Men"" is based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, which I have not read. It falls nicely into the oeuvre of darkly comic, intermittently gruesome crime films directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, though there is less plot than we usually get from the brothers Coen. In the parched border country of West Texas, 1980, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles across the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong, including a satchel full of money. He packs his wife off to her mother's and prepares to defend himself against whomever lays claim to the loot. That would be obsessive killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), whose trail of carnage has put Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) on his tail.The three main characters never meet, which contributes to the film's somewhat excessive length, as we must view them in separate scenes. Llewelyn, a working class Everyman who jumps at the chance for financial freedom, is pursued obsessively by Chigurh, with veteran lawman Bell bringing up the rear, bewildered by the nature of crime he sees nowadays. Chigurh is less a character than a force of nature. His actions seem to have no motivation. He represents all the bad stuff that bubbles to the surface when something in society goes  out of kilter -in this case a surge in the drug trade along the Mexican border in the early 1980s.This is one of the simplest plots I've ever seen filmed: An Everyman, Evil Incarnate, and a Good Guy, chasing one another, like ducks in a row. Perhaps it's too simple for a film of two hours. Tommy Lee Jones' earnest, deadpan delivery, and Chigurh's odd insistence on blaming fate for his actions helped keep my attention. But, apart from an allegory on violence that is so broad as to be meaningless, this is a chase movie that moves at a snail's pace. I was disappointed by the lack of complexity, but ""No Country for Old Men"" reminds me of  1990's ""Miller's Crossing"". Both films are violent, entertaining exercises in style, not substance, though this one is both funnier and more violent.The DVD (Miramax 2008): There are 3 bonus featurettes. ""The Making of No Country for Old Men"" (23 min) interviews the Coens about their attraction to the material and adapting the book, the cast about their roles, executive producer Robert Graf, and some creative and technical crew about recreating the 1980s.  In ""Working with the Coens"" (8 min), the cast and some crew talk about the Coens directing style. In ""Diary of a Country Sheriff"" (7 min), The Coens talk about the Bell and Chigurh characters.

That no matter what you did, it was never good enough for anyone or anything.  Would you persevere?  Just plain give up on trying?  Or would you lash out at God, after all when it seems the entire universe is against you, only one being could even possibly help you out of that kind of trouble.  If you chose the option of lashing out at God, which under some circumstances isn't necessarily a bad thing, as long as it's done in proper context and with respect for God.  By lashing out at God do you think that would solve your problems?  Do you think that God would snap his fingers and make your problems simply disappear or that maybe God would sort of take a vacation and give you His powers for a while to see if you could do His job better?  If you thought the answer about God giving you His powers was correct, then clearly you haven't been reading your Bible all that closely, but you have probably been watching or at least heard of the movie starring Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman, ""Bruce Almighty"".""Bruce Almighty"" is the story of a down-trodden news reporter, Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey), who believes that the entire world, nay the universe, is against him in all that he does.  Bruce's girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston), tries to assure him that one of these days things will begin to turn around for him, but Bruce doesn't believe this to be true.  So after lashing out at God in anger, accusing Him of not doing His job properly, Bruce is given a life-changing opportunity.  A personal visit with God (Morgan Freeman), leaves Bruce endowed with all of God's powers, and God challenges Bruce to see if he can do a better job than the Almighty God can.Truly one of Jim Carrey's most hilarious performances since ""Liar, Liar"" or ""Dumb and Dumber"", this over-the-top, laugh until you hurt comedy will leave you wanting to go back to watch it time and time again.  ""Bruce Almighty"" may come off as blasphemous to some, though I'm a Christian and I found it to not be blasphemous, but that's my opinion and not everyone agrees with me.  Though this movie is truly hilarious, there are some deep issues regarding faith, and man's relationship with God that get explored here.  Even though I don't believe this movie was written by a devout Christian, it still manages to deal with issues of free will, the corruption of absolute power, surrendering to God's will, and God's love for mankind, in very real and engaging ways that can be taken to heart by any Christian.  I truly believe that Christians should watch this movie, but bear in mind that there are moments that may be offensive to some, and times that tread on borderline blasphemous, but in the end this film steers clear of that territory, and comes out on top.I did say that I feel that Christians should watch this movie, but actually anyone who is looking for a movie that will have them laughing constantly should watch ""Bruce Almighty"".

The world had settled a score with Germany with the signing of the armistice which ended the first world war.The accord agreed to restricted the tonnage,that is the size and scope of germanys naval ambitions,just to mention one of the many restrictions placed on germany.One of the original ideas that germany pioneered in order to get around the restrictions was the advent of what we now know was the pocket battleship.The Bismarck was a very powerfull,if not the most powerfull ship afloat while she roamed the seas.I beleive though that the Japanese had the distinction of possessing the right to the most powerfull ship afloat during world war two.However, look no further than the bismarck! Destroyers and the like ran from her and to be absolutly straight up with you that was a ship to be reckoned with! There is another fact that might provide some help in this very important battle that is about to take place? The first world war brought an end to the era of the dreadnaught,which H.M.S. Hood was part of,though her place on the high seas was at a latter point in the first world war she still possessed a dreadnaught distinction.During a time between the wars and commencing a time immediately before the onset of hostilites of the second world war Hood underwent a makeover.Listen to this! those dreadnaught were slower than what was being done as the years passed and in an effort to make Hood faster she made a sacrifice of her plating.If you really want a shock wear do you think her plating was taken from?Right behind the stacks immediately over the area which protects the munitions.If ever there was a disaster waiting to happen it was that.I beleive that this might still be a conjecture as to the Hood blowing up,however the rest is history.I want to be clear this actually occured Hood was refitted and slimmed down and it may have cost her,her life.Long Live this Island nation-had it not been For the resolve of England on the high seas things may very well been different.This is not lessen any other aspect of the very dramatic time in world history but its dramatic detail cannot be overlooked-As a side note this picture drew enough attention that I think it was a singer who released a song at the time of the release of the film called Sink the Bismarck by johnny Horton.There not many events in history that entire movies are dedicated to,well,this is one.",4.0,0.2,1,2,-0.636,very negative,-0.8317,very negative,2003,5,25
344698,6302906652,AFMHBPOOCEK53,3,4,2002-01-22,Truer to Tolkien's literature than Peter Jackson's film(s).,"I first saw this film in 1978 when I was 13 years old and I loved it. I was a fan of Tolkien's literature (even though at the time it seemed a bit complex and confusing to me) before I saw the film. After having seen it, Bakshi's The LOTR fueled my imagination of Tolkien's world further by giving me a solid visualisation of it, and a partial rendering of it's story. My love and understanding for Tolkien's work and world has grown considerably over the years as I've matured. I'm 35 years old now and I still love this film when I watch it.I believe that the only valid criticism surrounding this film is criticism that comes from viewers who have read, understood, and are able to retain what they have read of Tolkien's literature (which rules out 75% of the fans of the Peter Jackson mega-budget film(s)), and who had initially seen this film in 1978/1979. Why? Because this film is based upon the most complex mediaeval-fantasy literature ever written, and shouldn't be viewed the same way as Harry Potter or The Chronicles Of Narnia. And because it was a different time back then; films were different, animation was different, special effects were different, perception was different, and culture was different. As well, one needn't read the books to enjoy this film; but one does need to read the books, and retain what one has read to understand and appreciate it.The most common complaints I've heard and read about this film are ones I would like to address. The most frequent complaint registered is that Bakshi edited out far too much of The Fellowship Of The Ring. Well of course he had to, didn't he? He was, after all, combining four books equalling two novels into one film for the cinema--not an easy achievement, especially if you're one who is familiar with the complexity of the books. (The only way to fully achieve a significant translation of Tolkien's The Lord Of The Rings would have to be in the form of a mini-series made for non-commercial television. Anyone interested?) As well, people complain about the film ending only half way through the story of The Lord Of The Rings. What they fail to understand is that another film based on the unfinished parts of The Two Towers and The Return Of The King was to follow. But Bakshi was denied the funds to produce it, so unfortunately nothing materialised. Another complaint is of the animation itself: rotoscoping. Rotoscoping is a technique of filming live actors and then drawing and painting directly over their images on the film to achieve an eerie realism. How can anyone say that the movements are unnatural when they are taken directly from live actors? I'll wager these same critics who say such an ignorant thing think that the computer-generated Cave Troll and Balrog in Jackson's film look and move realistically. Bakshi's animation is marvellous and breathtaking in this film, and he makes use of many creative and innovative techniques--even if they aren't all that pleasing to each individual set of eyes that view it.Bakshi's The Lord Of The Rings follows Tolkien's literature and dialogue with great respect. With a few exceptions, like Merry making the travel with Frodo, Sam, and Pippin across The Shire to Buckleberry, the Hobbits hiding all together in an alcove off the road whilst a Black Rider hovers above them (a scene Jackson stole from Bakshi), and Legolas meeting Aragorn and the Hobbits instead of Glorfindel, Bakshi only edits Tolkien's story and does not make significant changes to it (like Jackson does). Bakshi even throws in a few original things of his own, which add to the overall viewing pleasure.The voice talent in this film is absolutely superb, and is very characteristic to the personas of the people involved.As far as the physical character designs, and with the exception of the Hobbits not having curly hair, as well as the crude design of Aragorn, Bakshi's animated portrayals are right on (or very close to) the mark. I even accept Boromir's Nordic/Viking apparel and appearance as representative of Gondor strength--(after all, Tolkien loved stories about Vikings and had even formed a Viking Club with certain aquaintances and colleagues of his where they would get together in a local pub and read stories about Vikings to one another).Musically, Leonard Rosenman's original score is wonderfully fitting, and the best I've ever heard from him.The film's pacing and editing is actually very good--although does get a bit muddled towards the end, as befits the literature. I think people who may complain about the latter are forgetting that this is an adult fantasy story, and not a child's; and that it wasn't designed directly to appeal to those with a short attention span.Ralph Bakshi's The Lord Of The Rings with all its many faults and mistakes, nevertheless remains the only respectfully definitive work based on Tolkien's story put onto film thus far; much more so than Peter Jackson's dazzling live-action comic book-screenplay version (which, despite my criticism, I also love). Bakshi's The Lord Of The Rings is for the pure of heart fan of Tolkien's literature. Although it may not satisfy your appetite, it will certainly whet it.",4.0,0.75,1,1,0.3612,positive,0.994,very positive,2002,1,22

She rivals Shakespeare as the greatest artist of English literature.  Both writers were concerned with basic human motivation, but Austen limited her observation to what she knew best, the courtship of 18th Century men and women of all classes.  She particularly enjoyed matching rather struggling middle class girls with the Bill Gates of their day, the local nobility.Keira Knightley makes a lovely Elizabeth Bennet.  She's has every virtue and flaw that her love match, Mr. Darcy possesses, and there is the problem.  They are so alike, they are blind to each other's virtues initially, obsessing upon their human foibles instead, mostly their unmitigated pride.  But what smitten couple of any century is any different.  Ah, Austen is universally appreciated since she spotlights what most Earthly inhabitants will encounter one or more times in a lifetime, love.I think I may prefer the Laurence Olivier version made in the 1930's.  After all, his Darcy is superb, never to be duplicated, but this newer version uses modern color cinematography to advantage.  Jane Austen is always worthwhile.

""I'm So Excited,"" his latest confection-- actually his first full-deck comedy since ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown""-- is certainly no exception to what we have come to expect from this most gifted of directors. As always, the opening frames of what the critics are calling his gayest movie yet are a delight to behold. Then the fun begins with Antonio Banderas and Penelope Cruz making cameo appearances.  The movie is certainly high camp in every way since 99% of the action takes place several thousand feet above ground in a plane that is circling Toledo,  Spain because of  a landing gear problem.  Or as one character asks when she learns of the problem, ""Toledo, Ohio""?There is quite an assortment of crazy characters here: gay airline attendants,  a bisexual pilot, another pilot willing to experiment, an admitted unclaimed flower, a newly-wed couple, a hit man-- in a word quite a collection of over-the-top creations of Mr. Almodovar, most of them flying business class.  Although the movie is a tad long-- at about two hours-- and gets a bit claustrophobic, the delightful ending will blow you away and makes up for any minor deficiencies ""I'm So Excited"" may have.  The director takes his own advice here-- that comedy should not be concerned with political correctness-- as anything is likely to happen.Having seen in the past few days two fine but terribly sad movies ""The Attack"" and  ""Fruitvale Station"" I was so ready for Mr. Almodovar's latest gift that is guaranteed to make you smile.",4.0,0.5,2,1,0.0,neutral,0.7276,very positive,2013,7,27

One story line did not fit for me at all, it involved a writer who's brother set him to a nursing home, perhaps it was added for comic relief, however, it seemed like putting an SNL sketch in the middle of the movie.  I never did fully relate to many of the characters. Tom Hanks WAS a character to relate to in the 'most future' world (make sure you enable close captioning to get the most out of these segments as they use a 'future dialect' of English.). It was also quite distracting to use the same Mr. Smith character in the movie that the filmakers used for the Matrix.  He did a good job, but it did seem like a poor choice to use him I guess.  Unfortunately he is a bit cast type as being from the Matrix series.  The 'lifetime' in future Seoul Korea and the other 'future' life are well worth the watch.How would I rate it.  3.5 to 4 stars.  ....It is worth watching and is quite diffferent than most movies that you typically see, I do have to agree with other reviewers in that regard.

First off, Revolutions is much better and more satisfying than Matrix Reloaded, and the CGI effects are better as well.  Picking up right where Reloaded left off, Neo (Keanu Reeves) finds himself trapped between the real world and the artificial world of the Matrix while the war between man and machine rages on both fronts as the people of Zion defend the city against the endless swarms of sentinels and the multiplying Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) grows more powerful in the world of the Matrix.  There aren't as many jaw dropping action scenes (until the film's climax) that populated the previous two films, but the battle for Zion and the ultra epic Super Burly Brawl in which Neo and Smith fight for the final time are marvels of modern movie magic.  As a whole however, just like Reloaded, Revolutions just can't live up to the awe of the original film.  And as much as I like the two later entries of the series, I can't help but think that there never should have been a Matrix trilogy.  When we saw Neo fly towards the sky at the end of the first film, that should have been it, but naturally Warner Bros. knows how to milk a good thing dry.

It is deliberately over the top, (just look at the size of some of those jiggling spheres...could anyone draw those with a straight face?) silly, touching and effectively hilarious. Each character retains enough emotional depth and uniqueness to remain interesting and endearing throughout. (although, admittedly, I couldn't help but feel that Rin felt somehow incongruous most of the time)Anyone who approaches this anime expecting to see the pinochle of dramatic achievement is missing the point (and, quite frankly, is the biggest boob involved in this whole thing) Despite all of its assets, Maburaho does have some substantial flaws-the story REALLY loses its steam about halfway through the series and resorts to some pretty dull filler episodes before regaining its momentum towards the end, which brings up another problem...the ending is way too convenient...it certainly doesn't ruin the series, though and may even put a smile on your face. All in all, Maburaho is simply an anime to be laughed at-it was written, directed and animated as such, so why not just sit back and do just that? Who knows?

It isn't... but it is a respectable animated sequel. Wacked out Sutherland keeps referring to ""THE WIZARD OF OZ"" as ""The Judy Garland Version.""In L. Frank Baum's book ""THE LAND OF OZ"", Wicked Witch Mombi attempts to take over Emerald City and destroy the Scarecrow. She is defeated by a boy named Tip, Jack Pumpkinhead, and Woodenhead the Horse. Tip turns out to be a girl who Mombi transformed into a boy. Tip is actually Ozma, the rightful ruler of Oz, before the Humbug Wizard blew in. Sutherland and Ladd keep this basic plot structure, omit Tip/Ozma entirely, and put Dorothy in his/her place.For the film, Dorothy (beautifully voiced by Liza Minnelli) is back in Kansas. She starts to get that old feeling for Oz; a cyclone blows her and Toto back, and she battles Mombi, etc.""JOURNEY BACK"" had quite a journey itself. The excellent voice cast was recorded in 1960. But lack of finances delayed the film for well over a decade. ""JOURNEY BACK"" was finally finished and had a small  theatrical release around 1974. Apparently, nobody saw it. Scheimer, Sutherland, and Ladd sound understandably proud that the film has finally appeared on DVD. While not as magical as in the 1939 MGM live-action masterpiece, Oz is nicely depicted in animation here. The animation is much better than the Hanna-Barbera cheap and quick, Saturday morning TV show style. Apparently, a few of the animators who worked on ""JOURNEY BACK"" were former employees of Disney Studios. The animation was intially began overseas, while the voice cast  was recorded in New York City and Los Angeles.I am certainly no fan of that overblown Broadway hag Ethel Merman. But, having said that, Ethel is perfectly cast as animated hag /Witch Mombi. She looks and sounds frightening. Margaret Hamilton, the original Wicked Witch Of The West in 1939,  is briefly heard here as the voice of Aunt Em in Kansas. Paul Lynde is excellent as the voice of (Jack) Pumpkinhead. Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland's old partner at MGM, replaced a mis-cast Peter Lawford, as the voice of the Scarecrow. It is disappointing that (the added in to the film's plot) old friends The Tin Man and Cowardly Lion essentially whimp out on Dorothy when she asks them to help. Glinda (voiced here by opera star Rise Stevens) reappears to tell Dorothy she only has herself to rely on and sing a ho-hum slow ballad.At least ""JOURNEY BACK"" does not commit the unforgivable cinematic sins of the 1985 Disney live-action disaster ""RETURN TO OZ."" In that hideous film,  (AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS)  Aunt Em and Uncle Henry take Dorothy in for electric-shock therapy to have all memories of Oz removed from her mind!! Dorothy subsequently escapes to an Oz in serious dis-repair, devoid of joy and music. While the songs in ""JOURNEY BACK"" by Sammy Cahn and James Van Heusen may not be of the same quality, as the perfectly integrated, Academy- Award winning  ""THE WIZARD OF OZ"" score by Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg, it is still nice to hear Liza Minnelli sing such songs as ""Keep A Happy Thought,"" ""That Far-Away Land,"" and ""Feeling For Home"" in perfect ""Dorothy Gale From Kansas"" style. Apparently, Liza has exspressed regret in participating in ""JOURNEY BACK."" True, she sounds almost exactly like her mother Judy Garland did in 1939 here... but there's nothing wrong with that, especially not in this instance. In fact, the vocal similarity is likely the primary reason she was cast to ""voice"" Dorothy in the first place.I recommend ""JOURNEY BACK TO OZ"" to fans of Liza Minnelli-- and for Oz fans who would like another adventure/trip. After all, L. Frank Baum wrote 14 Oz book sequels himself.",4.0,0.5,2,1,0.4404,positive,0.9935,very positive,2008,1,2

109333,0790741660,A2RN2AO4BE6F4K,3,5,2001-08-02,Action - Reaction,"Movie Summary: Henri Young was caught stealing $5 to feed is little sister and ended up in prison on Alcatraz Island. Years later he is caught trying to escape. For this he incurs the wrath of the Associate warden. Henri is put into solitary confinement for over 3 years. He is savagely beaten and tortured during this time. When he is finally released back into the prison's general population he is barely human. At the prompting of another inmate, Henri attacks and kills the stool pigeon who ratted on the escape attempt and caused Henri to have to spend 3 years in the hole. Now Henri is accused of Murder in the First Degree and facing the death penalty. It's an open and shut case, a sure loser, so they give it to James Stamphill, a green lawyer fresh out of school, as a practice case. But there is one thing they didn't count on, that James would actually try to win.My Opinion: I had seen the trailer for Murder in the First on many other DVDs and finally got around to seeing it. The story takes place in the 1930s and I like this period of American history, so it is not surprising that I enjoyed the movie very much despite its purported &quot;flaws&quot;. One of the things that has been called a flaw is that it is only loosely based on a true story. This seems to bother some people. The real Henri Young was not so nice a guy and the prison Warden not so bad a guy. But we have to remember that this is a movie, made for entertainment purposes. Had they made a documentary instead, it would not have been nearly as entertaining. I don't consider this a flaw. The other weak point that people have brought up are the courtroom scenes. I enjoyed these but others have called them silly and contrived. They are not up to the realistic standards of show like Law and Order, but they are not that bad either. I did notice however that the DA did not cross examine Henri which seemed strange. These &quot;flaws&quot; or weaknesses fade into the background however if you catch onto the main themes which are friendship and freedom. I enjoyed these parts of the movie the most. To see how different things were important to Henri and James was very interesting. To James it started out as just a case he had to win. To Henri it was a chance to have a friend for the first time in his life. In the end they share both. As for the acting, I thought both Slater and Bacon were excellent. I forgot at times that it was Kevin Bacon and saw him as Henri. For a star as highly recognizable as Kevin Bacon, I think this is a big compliment.DVD Quality: Widescreen Anamorphic 1.85:1 (not 2.35:1 as listed) and full screen, DD2.0. Good picture quality. No extra features what so ever.What You Should Do:  See it if you like Court Room dramas. Christian Slater and Kevin Bacon both give great performances which are worth seeing. This is a very low priced DVD so it doesn't cost much more to buy than to rent so that is an option as well.Related Movies To Check Out: True Crime, The Untouchables, To Kill a Mocking Bird",4.0,0.6,2,1,0.0,neutral,0.7283,very positive,2001,8,2
444989,6305038775,ABE8YHLYSM15G,0,0,2012-06-23,Excellent depiction of WWI French Army in forgotten 1918 Salonika and occupation,"""Capitaine Conan"" is an authentic French film written and directed by Bertrand Tavernier, set in the last months of the Great War and the occupation in Eastern Europe. This film has a very orignal feel to it; the uniforms, locations, dialogue and writting are superb and distinct from any other war movie that I have seen.  Although there are gripping combat scenes from the Balkans front and the little known Expedition against the Bolsheviks in the years immediately following the war, the primary theme of the movie is the command structure within the French Army and the plight of the average combat soldier, many of whom had been in continous action since the Marne in 1914.The film begins with the date of September 10,  1918 on the Greek border with Bulgaria.  The French unit under Captain Conan is the film's focus, with the first scene putting the viewer right in the midst of the darkness and confusion that accompanies an infantry soldier's duties. The location for the film was excellent; the semi-arid and rocky hills that function as the battlefield in the little known Salonika front create a labrynth of escarpments, peaks (which are named by numbers), and gullies, perfect for the concealment of artillery, which create bombardments that are powerfully real to the viewer. There are no great histrionics to the fighting; it shows the infantry's job in realistic advances during the war wide push in late September.The fighting seems very realistic  (though it is not nearly as cataclysmic as the ""over the top"" scenes in movies such as War Horse and Legends of the Fall), but this movie might dissapoint a viewer looking for a straight combat diary like ""Saving Private Ryan."" The combat scenarios are far less than half of the two hour and ten minute movie. What it does do is put the viewer into the end of the Great war in a little known front, and as such the men under the hot tempered and fierce Conan recieve little credit for the years and years of suffering they have endured for their country.  After watching this movie, it is clear why French military morale dropped off to nothing in the inter war period, and made WWII a shameful chapter in their nation's history. The aristocratic and haughty demeanor of the Generals is put forth in a obvious manner, but not one that makes villians out of them like Stanley Kubrick's ""Paths to Glory."" They are merely trying to preserve their system and its rigid sense of order, often at the cost of men who break the disciplinary code after the war is over and have severe PTSD (which at the time was unrecognized and percieved as a sign of weakness).The principal characters are Norbert and Conan, who both fight the Army hierarchy to obtain justice for their men when they break the law during the post war occupation of Romania. Norbert is an ethical student of literature who defends the rights of the common solider, yet his reason also tells him when men have crossed the line and need to be punished. Conan is kind of a maverick, who despite his nobility volunteered for infantry service and is revered by his men.  During the occuapation the viewer sees through him the ultimate leader of men, commanding their loyalty and doing anything to protect them, even when they do step out of line. This film was quite extrodinary and elucidates the heart of the French Army at the twilight of its potency.",4.0,0.0,1,1,0.4215,positive,-0.9168,very negative,2012,6,23

Ok, critics (and his devoted fans alike) would love it because of its fantastic style; whereas some other audience would loath the day they decided to watch it, saying ""It's slow, pompous, and not so interesting.""  Me?  I still don't know.Whichever you may respond, one thing is clear: Billy Bob is a great actor even when he plays a role of an ordinary barber in the late 40s, whose life has been, and will be full of disillusion.  Ed Crane, Bob Thornton's character, is a loser, and he knows it, and tells it through his opening narrations.  Even when he is chain-smoking with a cool style, he knows it.  Or even when a stranger came to have a haircut, and talked about investment of ""dry-cleaning,"" he just listens silently.  With $10,000 you can be rich?  Never believe that!  But he thinks about it later; maybe his life could be changed a little.  Just a little.  So, he sits behind a typewriter and wrote a short note to Dave, a boss of a department store where his wife Doris works, and with whom Doris probably is having an affair.  Here is another Coen Brother's favorite topic -- one wrong footstep gradually leading to abyss.But do not try to ""relate"" to any characters of the film, let alone Ed.  Just watch how he slowly -- yes, slowly and steadily -- involves people around him into a murder case that eventually changes their lives, especially Ed's.  The story, however, is told in a most dispassionate way, and the hero is captured with a detached tone.  Many people rightly compared the film's black-and-white styles to those of film noir of the 1940s, but thrills or suspence is carefully removed from the entire work.  Don't try to hear a big noise when Ed gets a car crash.  You only see his car flying slowly across the screen -- and from an unexpected angle.Since the Brother thought about the original idea in 1994, the film took a long time to be made, and perhaps too long.  Sometimes, we must admit, the film seems to wallow in unnecesary and ineffective dialogues -- reference to Roswell and its famous UFO incident don't just work within tightly-knit script, and maybe as they did in ""Blood Simple"" Joel and Ethan Coen should have cut some part of the film off, which runs nearly 2 hours.  And while reliable and underrated Tony Shalhoub is given a big, prominent role (a rare thing, indeed) as a lawyer who convinces anybody of ANYTHING for his expensive fee, Frances McDormand, good as she is, is somehow wasted.  Total impression is that the film is a bit stretched at certain places and at its ending it looks slightly hurriedly told.""The Man Who Wasn't There"" belongs to the best things Coens did, though it doesn't reach the height of excellent ""Fargo.""  Recommended for Billy Bob's deft acting, and Roger Deakins's photography is another plus, but not a place to start watching the Brothers's original works.  Watch ""Fargo"" first if you haven't, then you might savor the unique style of them.",4.0,0.0,22,1,0.7003,very positive,0.9879,very positive,2002,7,10

This movie proves he has the chops for it, though.The film follows Ken Boyd (Corrigan), a wanna-be artist who is fresh out of a mental institution. Now living with his mother (a delightful Karen Black, although her character gets a little annoying near the end of the film), Ken sullenly scoops ice cream at a local diner and tries not to hate his life too much. Accompanied by his well-meaning, self-proclaimed loser friend, Irv (Leo Fitzpatrick), Ken must deal with locals who mock him for his past, as well as a prodigal daughter, Amy, who returns to complicate his life with her precociousness. Meanwhile, some guy who kills people is viciously murdering all of Ken's old enemies.Amy is played nearly perfectly by the young Ariel Gade, and Corrigan turns in a remarkably subtle performance as the tormented artist who can barely mask his fear of and longing for regular society. Lucy Davis (of the UK The Office) plays a wide-eyed love interest, and Barry Bostwick does an excellent job as the spacey sheriff who is perhaps a little sharper than he seems.The script and acting are all top-notch, although the flick is obviously low-budget, which is most evident in some of the death scenes. In fact, the only reason I don't give the movie a full five stars is because the climax is clumsily choreographed and edited, making it seem rushed and awkward.

Who would have thought?,"""Ginger Snaps"" is a low budget werewolf flick from Canada but that statement hardly does it justice. What we have here is one of the most intelligent horror flicks that have been produced in recent times. What it lacks in special effects it more than makes up for with superb writing and a cast that's capable of making it all come together.Ginger and Brigitte are teenage sisters that are struggling through the very awkward years of puberty. They help each other through all the confusion and trials by imagining morbid fantasies of their own suicides and making pacts that they will stay together forever whether living or dead. But things become far more taxing when Ginger is bitten by a werewolf and starts to turn. Her pubescent changes are now exacerbated by her gradual transformation into a lycanthrope. With her growing power comes a previously unknown popularity at her school that separates her from Brigitte along with her concern and help.The choice to combine both feminine pubescence and lycanthropy is pure genius. ""They don't call it the curse for nothing"" is the tagline of the film and really displays this films split themes. It's both a story about growing up and a horror yarn based on werewolf mythology. The cast are simply fabulous! Emily Perkins' Brigitte suitably appears insecure and apprehensive about life in general. Her character struggles to look people in the eyes and has an almost pathetic look that she cowers behind. Katharine Isabelle is also awesome as Ginger. She oozes both adolescent nonchalance and sexual energy throughout the film. I found myself laughing hysterically several times throughout due to her morbid one-liners and looks of disgust at the world around her. While her transformation into a deadly beast may have been a difficult one as an actress, she pulled it off beautifully, remaining both expressive and sexy in equal doses. The other actress that deserves a mention is Mimi Rogers, not simply due to her being the most well-known of the cast, but due to her role as the sisters' mother. She portrays an extremely caring mother that's totally detached from the reality of her children. It's a demanding role and she performs admirably.""Ginger Snaps"" is almost totally devoid of cliches and manages to be both very funny and quite horrifying at times. It's not all that gory (although dogs do not fair well in this film), but it is a little bit disturbing in its use of violence and teenage struggles in tandem. For such a low budget movie I think the special effects are really very good, yet those used to Hollywood blockbusters should not go in expecting too much. The transformation effects are fantastic, yet the actual werewolves once completed are rather fake looking. But I'm willing to accept that due to the unique qualities of this film and find it to be thoroughly entertaining as a film that traverses several genres.

Before you start thinking Pulp Fiction, Liman is smarter than that. There are homages here and there to Tarantino, sure, but there's nothing overt that will allow you to cry rip-off.Liman's greatest strength, perhaps, is in turning the Hollywood stereotype on its ear; he's not afraid to cast bigger names in smaller roles (Taye Diggs, Breckin Meyer, Scott Wolf, and Katie Holmes all play small but pivotal roles, while the leads are given to Sarah Polley, Desmond Askew, and Jay Mohr) and allow the relative unknowns&#8212;Polley, Askew, and Mohr are all better-known for TV work than film work, or were before this film&#8212;to do their thing, and do it well.Yes, the movie's a comedy, in the same sick way that Very Bad Things is a comedy. You'll laugh, but you'll feel guilty for doing it. The chemistry between the many relationships that unfold in the film is dead-on every time, and Liman never loses track of the chemistry between the characters we see onscreen together rarely, but stay in contact (e.g. Simon [Askew] calling his friend and drug dealer Todd Gaines [Timothy Olyphant], shown from both perspectives in the first two segments). It's fast, it's slick, it's oodles of fun.

While there is some film grain in certain scenes, it is soft rather than gritty.  It did not call attention to iself.

612579,B00005JM4B,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,1,1,2012-05-19,"(3.5 Stars) Bringing Down the House"" is a hilarious and fun comedy that will make people laugh today as it did ten years ago!","In 2003, the romantic comedy ""Bringing Down the House"" starring Steve Martin and Queen Latifah would earn over $164 million in the box office.Directed by Adam Shankman (""Hairspray"", ""Bedtime Stories"", ""A Walk to Remember"") and written by Jason Filardi (""17 Again"", ""Back Nine""), despite mixed reviews from critics, the film would become a financial success and also earning Queen Latifah a NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture and also a Teen Choice Award for ""Choice Movie Actress Comedy"".And to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of the film, Touchstone Home Video entertainment will be releasing the film on Blu-ray.VIDEO:Perhaps the biggest difference from the original DVD release of ""Bringing Down the House"" is the film's video quality.  Presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 2:35:1), ""Bringing Down the House"" looks absolutely vibrant with this new digital transfer.The outdoor scenes look amazing, no sign of the artifacts from the older DVD release, the clarity and detail is much more apparent in the Blu-ray release and for those who love this film, may want to upgrade to this latest Blu-ray release.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Bringing Down the House"" is one of those films where you expect dialogue to be the primary focus and if anything, audio primarily coming from the center and front channels.  But ""Bringing Down the House"" is also a film known for its music soundtrack, from Queen Latifah to Robert Palmer, the soundtrack does have its fair share of  hip hop and pop music and the soundtrack does feature a good amount of bass during those music-driven scenes.  Dialogue is crystal clear and for the most part, the lossless soundtrack is definitely a step-up from the original DVD verison.SPECIAL FEATURES""Bringing Down the House: 10th Anniversary Edition"" comes with the following special features:Breaking Down ""Bringing Down the House"" - (16:33) Interview with Adam Shankman and the cast of ""Bringing Down the House"".The Godfather Hop - (2:57) A featurette focusing on Eugene Levy's character, Howie.""Better than the Rest"" Music Video - (3:44) Queen Latifah's music video.Deleted Scenes - (4:10) Featuring four deleted scenes: Ashley Spies on Charlene, More Golfing with Arness, Howie confronts Peter on Humping and Charlene Bitch Slaps Mike.Gag Reel - (4:00) Featuring the bloopers from ""Bringing Down the House"".JUDGMENT CALL:While ""Bringing Down the House"" was not exactly a favorite of film critics, part of the success of the film is because of its mismatching of talents.  One would never expect Steve Martin and Queen Latifah to be in a film together, yet they did and for the most part succeeded.While Steve Martin usually delivers in his role, what brought a fun atmosphere was Queen Latifah, who served as Executive Producer for the film but also worked closely with director Adam Shankman and writer Jason Filardi to bring some credibility to her character, know what kind of slang and terminology would go well with the audience, especially since both are complete opposites but at the same time, during this point in their lives, they realize how much they need each other.It's hard to believe 10-years has gone by since the release of this film in theaters, and while most of the cast members have gone on to bigger things (especially the young Angus T. Jones, who is now among the highly paid actors on television (ala ""Two and a Half Men""), the film's comedy still works today as it did in 2003.  It's one thing to see Steve Martin deliver his one-liners, but to see Queen Latifah show off her comedy skills, even a little action with actress Missi Pyle, its the chemistry that seemed odd at first, comes together in this crazy, farcical film.  It's one of those films that you want to watch, get away from reality and just laugh at how crazy the situations are.Eugene Levy escapes from his fatherly comedy routine that he tends to play on the ""American Pie"" films and plays the sex-crazed lawyer who just lusts after Charlene and is blunt of how he feels towards her. Betty White plays the bigot neighbor across the street who runs out of the house after hearing Charlene scream and telling Peter ""I hear Negro!"".  There are jokes that Queen Latifah brought to the film, that may raise eyebrows but she knew what jokes would work well with a diverse audience.As for the Blu-ray release, the film looks fantastic and definitely an upgrade over the previous DVD release.  The special features are pretty much the same content that was on the original DVD but for those who want to upgrade or those strictly looking for a comedy to watch and have a good time, ""Bringing Down the House"" is a film worth considering.Sure it's farcical film that may be too absurd for some,  but for those who aren't looking for anything too serious but something just to watch and laugh, will find ""Bringing Down the House"" an entertaining comedy.Overall, ""Bringing Down the House"" is a hilarious and fun comedy that will make people laugh today as it did ten years ago.",4.0,1.0,8,1,0.908,very positive,0.9989,very positive,2012,5,19

943962,B000BKSJ52,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,1,1,2012-12-23,A Solid Anime For All Ages,"Daisuke Niwa is 14 years old. He is the next Phantom Dark. Each generation of Niwa males shares their body with the legendary thief, Phantom Dark. Phantom Dark is frowned upon by society as a common criminal. The public doesn't know that he actually steals cursed artwork and artifacts. The young Daisuke has a crush on Risa Harada. Risa only has eyes for the Phantom thief. The one who actually loves Daisuke is the older Harada twin, Riku. Now this dilemma seems simple to me. Tell them both that you are Niwa as well as Phantom Dark. Or just choose the sister you like and be with her. Personally, I think that Risa is a bit shallow and clueless. I would definitely go for the more sincere Riku. I'll let you watch and find out who the winner is. Anyway, for the bond between Dark and Daisuke to be broken, and their duty fulfilled 2 things must happen: 1. Daisuke must steal his sacred maiden, and 2. Dark must defeat his rival, Krad. The drama and action is very good. This series is very solid.D.N. Angel is a really good show. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are very good. You'll recognize the main characters. Vic Mignogna, Luci Christian, and Hilary Haag all play the major characters. There is a good mix of action, drama, romance, and comedy in this series. There are times when it seems to drag, and get into some unimportant story arcs. I think that the potential for this anime was higher than it actually achieved. If the useless arcs were used for relationship and character development, it could have reached its true potential and became a 5 star series. Because of those things, it was a solid 4 star series. I don't want to make it sound like this series was disappointing. It didn't disappoint. It was very good, and I'm glad I bought it. It's definitely a show that I'll revisit in the future. By no means is it one of the best anime series out there though.It does have another strong point that separates it from many other shows. While many anime series out there today are quite perverted and geared toward males. This is a very clean and wholesome show. The characters have very sweet and pure personalities. There isn't really any fan service; unless you count the beach trip episode. The language is very mild. These things are kind of nice to see in an anime. Boobs, perverts, and Yuri are very overdone themes in anime nowadays. Although I get a kick outta that stuff once in a while, it's not essential to a strong series. I like that D.N. Angel kept it clean. It's one that you can share with the whole family. It will even teach younger kids a few important lessons about love, friendship, and family.I apologize for rambling a bit. I had a lot to say about this show. In conclusion I recommend this series to all anime fans over the age of 8 or so. It's not the best series out there, but it's very solid and has some cute and innocent love and drama. I really enjoyed D.N. Angel and I hope you do too.",4.0,1.0,3,1,0.1531,neutral,0.9942,very positive,2012,12,23

Really."") story of a young doctor Dr. Mortimer Granville (played by Hugh Dancy) in London, 1880, who is struggling but eventually finds a job with Dr. Robert Dalrymple (played brillantly by Jonathan Pryce) who is treating women for the so-called hysteria disease, really a catch-all for any and all things supposedly wrong with women in those days. The treatment is nothing else but to touch these women's private parts until they reach ""paroxysmal convulsions"" (wink, wink). The young doctor along with his buddy eventually come up with a mechanical device, which became the vibrator (still the number one sex toy in the world today, we are reminded at the end of the movie).But the movie in fact is much more about Granville's romantic interplay with the 2 daughters of Dalrymple, Emily (played by Felicity Jones), who is ""daddy's girl"" and to whom Granville gets engaged, and Charlotte (played by  Maggie Gyllenhaal), the ""rebel"" daughter who has set up a social center to help the poor. I don't want to give away much more from the plot, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Maggie Gyllenhall really shines in this movie. I couldn't help but think how much she reminded me of Diane Keaton in her late 70s performances (think Annie Hall). That aside, this movie is a pleasant romcom, nothing more, nothing less.

I thought it would just be a second rate ""My So-called Life.""  But all of the praise heaped on this dvd set tempted me, so I bought it.  In two words, it is simply wonderful.  I didn't think it was anything special after two episodes, but since I had paid for the whole set, I  kept watching.  By the tenth episode, I was totally hooked.  There are almost no cheap gags in this series (although at times it is hilarious); almost none of the scenes strike a false note.  It is just the everyday portrayal of 11th grade Lindsay Weir and her 9th grade brother, Sam, their family and their friends, and, of course, high school in 1981.  The humanity of each of the characters, whether they are the burnouts (inexplicably called the freaks) with whom Lindsay, a top student, starts to hang out with, or the (aptly named) geeks, Sam's friends, is subtly but fully portrayed.  By the last episode, I was almost in tears -- not because it was sad, but because I couldn't believe the series was over; that I would not be able to follow the lives of these characters anymore.  I think I will always miss them.  The ""special features"" such as the deleted scenes and the commentary are nothing special unless you are obsessed with F&G.  But that takes nothing away from this seductively sweet show.  The network should be ashamed that it did not renew it.

I liked the fact that it was set during WWII, which made this comic book adaptation unique, and it has a fair amount of humor that never seemed forced.The acting is better than you would expect thanks to a surprisingly restrained performance from Chris Evans as Captain America and a scene stealing Tommy Lee Jones. Hugo Weaving does his usual good job as the villain Red Skull, but I didn't find him to be menacing enough to stand out from all the other comic book baddies. Still, he always plays the evil roles so well. Hayley Atwell, who I had previously seen in the TV miniseries The Pillars of the Earth, is not only gorgeous, but a better than average love interest. She actually fights, rather than just standing around looking pretty.There is a lot of CGI and most of it looks good, especially the scrawny version of Chris Evans, but thankfully it is not overused like in The Green Lantern.The only negatives would be that it does drag a little in spots and the hero himself doesn't have any cool powers (like The X-Men) or any cool gadgets (like Batman), other than a kicka** shield that can be thrown like a boomerang. He is just stronger and faster thanks to an experiment that turns a 90 pound weakling into a 220 pound beat down machine.I had fun with this one.

Seeing the previews months before hand I couldn't wait to grab hold of this and thanks to my Amazon friends who had already watched and rated this reminded me how anxious I wanted to see this. If films couldn't get any more bizarre imagine a strain of VD so powerful that one encounter with a carrier essentially kills you. The rub is that in this case, VD stands not for venereal disease but rather for the Latin "" vagina dentata,"" e.g. ""toothed vagina."" If Russ Meyer had made this film, it would have been called Faster, Pussy! Kill! Kill! As it stands, the only real precursor to Teeth is a 2003 low-budget British comedy-horror film with the unlikely title of Penetration Angst.That's certainly what some male viewers may feel after watching Teeth. The three main scenes of phallus interruptus leave nothing to the imagination and give a whole new meaning to the porn industry term `money shot.' Taken together, they add up to an experience that is tantamount to the ""anti-date movie."" Seriously, even if a female companion was hot to trot after the show, it's likely her male movie going pal would be too freaked out by all the slicing and dicing to take her up on it.Unlike Fiona Horsey, the talented newcomer who has done nothing of note since the aforementioned Penetration Angst, the Juilliard grad star of Teeth, Jess Weixler, is already headed for bigger things. By sheer coincidence, today is the day casting was confirmed for the movie version of Peter and Vandy, Jay DiPietro's adaptation of his popular 2002 play of the same name. DiPietro co-starred as Peter, but in this case it's Jason Ritter who will have the honors opposite Weixler.Teeth is very much a cult movie, a horror comedy to be devoured by thrill seeking genre fans. It's likely that Peter and Vandy will be more the kind of movie that really introduces Weixler to a wide audience, making good on the promise of her Special Jury Prize at last year's Sundance Film Festival (""For a juicy and jaw-dropping performance""). Still, her fearlessness in Teeth is to be commended. She dives into the role with abandon and is even willing for the sake of the film to do a revealing topless scene in this, her first major movie role.Most people will know Weixler from a MasterCard TV commercial in which she plays a gal with a new job who, a la Mary Tyler Moore, skips about town while flaunting its features. The way things are taking shape, this Louisville, Kentucky native's real life debit account may also soon have her brimming with uptown energy.",4.0,0.6666666666666666,6,1,0.0,neutral,0.9837,very positive,2008,9,8

This is a remake of the pretty dull 1960s Las Vegas heist movie of the same title starring Frank Sinatra and the rest of the Rat Pack. I've seen both films and I must say that this is one of those rare exceptions where the remake improves on the original.Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is an ex-con newly released from prison who immediately jumps back into the shady life. He already has a larcenous scheme in mind and enlists his old right-hand man Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) to help him recruit a thieving crew. Oh and what a crew: Matt Damon as the rookie, quick-fingered and well versed in pickpocketing; Bernie Mac as the inside man; Don Cheadle, the explosives expert, comes armed with a great Cockney accent and that weird Cockney way of rhyming (""We're in Barney""; Clooney makes a nonplussed gesture; ""Barney Rubble - Trouble!""); old-school Carl Reiner plays the old con-man out for a last con; Casey Affleck is the nerdy computer/surveillance technoman; etc. Ocean and company target the super-protected vault underneath the Bellagio casino. This vault stores money for three casinos: the Bellagio itself, as well as the MGM Grand and the Mirage. Apparently, on weekend nights of big boxing events, the vault by law has to house at least $150 million to cover all bets. The man who owns the Bellagio is Terry Benedict (played with smooth, reptilian menace by Andy Garcia), who is also the current love of Ocean's ex Tess (a radiant Julia Roberts). Hmmm, you start to think.Ocean's motivations are not the only thing that'll keep the viewer guessing in this funny, fast-paced, twisty film. The director Steven Soderbergh skillfully plays fast and loose with flashbacks, dizzying, continuing pan shots and sleight-of-hand camerawork. There is plenty of false jeopardy played out in the course of this movie, numerous plot reversals. Don't take anything for granted until the end credits come up.Steven Soderbergh directs this remake with such a light touch that it seems as if all he's done is throw all these high-profiled megastars in the same room and direct them, with perhaps a nonchalant wave of a hand, to simply wing it. The performers deliver their lines convincingly and with panache. They are, after all, all damn good actors (check out the dvd actor commentary with Damon, Pitt and Garcia, who have a chuckle over the talented serious actor Don Cheadle, who delivers his lines while covered in poo). I had a sense that everyone involved genuinely liked each other and had a great time bouncing off each other in their scenes. Clooney and Pitt, in particular, seem to have great buddy rapport together, whilst romantically, Clooney and Roberts sizzle. Andy Garcia is a great villain, suave yet intense, worthy of going up against eleven crafty adversaries. Soderbergh does a masterful juggling act in this one: ensuring that everyone in the film gets his/her day to shine, managing to stage every scene so that every shot is interesting and keeping the topsy-turvy plot on point. Kudos, too, to the music, which works to great effect and greatly influences the mood of every stage of the film (I thought actually purchased the soundtrack). Great job by everyone involved.

Post- OD, literally having come back from the edge death, the chase for the criminals continues with out a flinch.At times this police tenacity is too exaggerated to be believable. The chase for the bad guys goes on endlessly for days. None of the cops ever eat or sleep. They seem to have inexhaustible resources at their disposal.

As we are to expect, the movie does'nt follow any story line from the games, although it is very similar to that of the first; in which our lead ""Rose"" whom replaces ""Harry"" of the first game, is in search of her missing daughter. As the movie progresses we see familiar characters, like Dhalia Gillespie and the nurse Lisa, whom has a small role in the film. We're also witness to various creatures we've encountered in the game, more notably Pyramid Head  and the Nurses.We also seeother memorable creatures, like the little ghosts and a freaky new one called ""the Janitor"". The film combines elements from all four games. Like the monsters from the second, and various little enviroment and characters details from the others. The movie keeps the games music which adds to the excellent atmosphere the film presents.I think the look and atmosphere are one of the strongest elements in the movie.They spared no expense in the blood and gore department, especially towards the end. Another aspect I thoroughly enjoyed was the transition between the real world and the dark. It's very reminiscent of the game, especially when we hear that dreadful siren, warning our character of what to come. I felt that the explanantion and ending itself seemed a bit rushed.Other than a couplefairly slow paced sequences, the first half was brilliantly plyed out, with a mix of moody atmosphere and freaky characters.Then as we reach our climax we seemingly get rushed explanation and ending, which did not really fit the feel of the first part of the movie. Regardless, I still enjoyed the film the film from start to finish. Overall fans of the game may be dissapointed by the thin story line, but in ways it makes it up.with excellent use of the games music, along with the right atmosphere and a fair amount of blood and gore. Look out for some of the more notable creatures in the movie, as they look very much like they do in the games.In the modern age of remakes amd games to film adaptation, Silent Hill sucessfully pulls off a creepy movie  that stays true to the games it's based on. If only it did'nt seem so rushed towards the end could have been better. Still though I say bring on part TWO!!

In fact, the animation is precisely what makes this film work so well.  A synopsis of the plot is impossible, but essentially a gen-X type character drifts in (and out?) of a dream state.  Along the way, he talks to various deep thinkers who share their ideas about dreams, life, and religion.  The different actors kind of play themselves and primarily deliver monologues to the main character, who is frequently passive.  Sounds pretty grim, but it's definitely not.  True, if this movie wasn't animated, it would be incredibly pretentious.  However, the animation, which is spectacular, really helps ground this film.There are certain scenes I'll never forget from this film, particulary the revelation that one cannot turn off the lights in dreams (whether that's true or not is irrelevant).  Different segments of the film have been done by different animators, which helps keep things fresh throughout.  Most of the stars are not well-known, but watch for Ethan Hawke and Nicky Katt, among others.I avoided seeing this film in the theaters, despite the stellar reviews, because I am not a fan of movies that explore philosophical or religious issues in such depth.  However, I found myself enjoying the movie immensely.  It's funny and thought provoking.

She is a writer who is leaving her life to pursue her writing dreams and find fulfillment in publishing a novel.Her husband is not interested in her dreams. She decides to seek solitude in an isolated orange grove in Florida. Little does she know, this will not be an ideal life. After 30 years of urban life, she is not prepared for a small Florida town.After many rejections, Marjorie finally realizes ""Gothic Novels"" are not her specialty. Her agent helps her see how interesting her life actually is and she begins to write about what she knows best. In the process she falls in love, makes a best-friend, helps the community by hiring everyone who lives around her to help remodel her house and fix up her orchard.Cross Creek is based on the best-selling memoirs of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings and has some very human moments when you realize the beauty or ugliness of life. The local business man (Peter Coyote) who falls in love with her, does something so amazing. It reminded me of when my father bought my mother her first car. I only know the story, but the situation is similar. Marjorie of course is very head strong and not about to take help from another man. Until she realizes what Norton Bascomb has secretly done.Slow-paced movie that is more ""cute"" than ""dramatic."" Although, there are a few heart-wrenching moments.

The script is funny without being frantic and spiritual without being sentimental and the cinematography is simple yet often elegant.  But the real sparkle of the film comes from the extremely enjoyable performances offered by an ensemble cast led by Rosalind Russell as the formidable Reverend Mother and Haley Mills and June Harding as her problem students.  Russell gives one her best performances here, Haley Mills is her equal every step of the way, and June Harding is equally enjoyable; the truly memorable supporting cast includes the likes of Binnie Barnes and Gypsy Rose Lee.

They end up competing against an existing popular high school band, and have to fight through the usual doubts and ostracization, as well as each having parental difficulties to overcome.

Especially at the end of the movie, when she should have been pretty big and Kenya acts like he doesn't know that she's not pregnant anymore. It was pretty weak. Other than that though great movie.

He achieved a glimmering one in this hidden gem adapted from author Pat Conroy's novel, &quot;The Water Is Wide.&quot; Its movie version, retitled &quot;Conrack,&quot; has the amazing Jon Voight in the real-life role of teacher that Conroy played for a year on a South Carolina island inhabited by mostly African-Americans living in absolutely poverty and ignorance, and virtually forgotten by the world outside. The illiterate children, unable to pronounce Conroy's name, can do no better than &quot;Conrack,&quot; thus, the title. Realizing all too soon that he has the near insurmountable challenge of teaching what school administrators have dismissed as the unteachable, Conrack comes up with the strategy of teaching by applying knowledge to his childrens' everyday lives. His efforts, and the childrens' steadily emerging ability to learn, make for an assortment of human emotions, from frustration to out-and-out howling to the bittersweet of the childrens' recognition and acceptance of their lot in life. But while teaching and learning make progress, school administrators are less than impressed by Conrack's methods, and the film head toward the inevitable clash between teacher and school officials and the resolution, we are lead to conclude, is at the childrens' expense. As Conrack, Voight is both stirring and moving without being phony, and he convinces us that the teacher's only agenda is his pupils' betterment. But the child actors who make up the pupils are incredible! They actually make us believe we are listening to a socially and educationally decimated and totally forgotten other world.

Is it a Twilight Zone Movie in which you're dealing with soul transference & time travel? Could be? A Faustian bargain? Are you dealing with the roving inner eye of an insane mind? That was my choice & this review will reflect that choice.The movie starts with a man & his wife whose house is being video taped from the inside. Is this being done by an outsider, evil spirit or is this the act of a sinister plan inside the home? I say inside job. If you're messed up enough to shoot video of your place to deceive yourself or your mate, putting it in an envelope & leaving it outside is no biggee.What a lovely relationship they have too. He's freaked out & she's subservient enough but also obviously has the quiet confidence to plan her way through her troubles. Enter now, the best character of the movie only listed as ""mystery man"", Robert Blake. He's never gone anywhere he states, that he wasn't invited. Sounds like an evil spirit all right & remember they've talked before. In my book they've talked many times, like each night as Pullman roves the corridors of his insane & escape proof mind.You get a murder, an arrest & a conviction. So neat & tidy plus added stress on an already bent mind. What happens in Pullman's cell at night is the key to whether you go towards Twilight Zone or insanity. Is Bill Pullman & Balthazar Getty the same man? Is Pullman actually in prison or is he in the prison for the criminally insane with a real body played by Getty.I chose Balthazar Getty as the real & very, very, sick, person in this movie. Pullman is Getty's uber-human. Pullman is what Getty wants to be. Not an auto mechanic that lives at home with mommy & daddy, BTW- great cameo's here on ma & pa, but a musician in a nice apartment with a super hot lady that belongs to one of the BIG people in his little man's world. I mean Getty covets everything he perceives as being above his station in life, the car, the women & in the end the will to be violent to obtain his desires.Now for the lady, & thank you Mr. Lynch for Patricia. This girl wants the money & there is nothing she won't do to get it. Attracted to power like a drunk to alcohol she has finally realized that if she has the money she can be the power, not bask in someone else's. Now look at how they meet. She did sorta make the pick herself. She picked that punk as soon as she saw he couldn't take his eyes off her while she was still in the car. Lamb to the slaughter she thinks, but this isn't Body Heat even though Patricia puts out tons of that.Actually I believe the movie is pretty straight forward once you decide if you're watching Rod Serling's Twilight Zone or if you're seeing inside the mind of a little man with big dreams that went terribly awry & landed him in the prison we can't escape, our own minds.The men's dreams are trashed. The woman's dreams are killed. Even the Big Boss is pancaked out of his dream in the desert. The only winner here is ""Mystery Man"" who never goes where he's not invited. Where does Mystery Man come from & where does he go to? Whose call does he answer? Isn't it to be expected that as the police close in for the capture, no O J here, Mr. Getty begins to revert back to his other identity. Sorta like Psycho without the maternal leanings so no insipid weakness.I give the movie 5 stars for entertainment value as you can get sucked in here and wake up 2 hr's later thinking only 25 min's passed. Lot's of misdirection.I give Patricia anything she wants. I'll be Getty for her.The rest of the cast gets 4 stars except Blake who gets 5.Movie rating is 4 1/2 stars.A nice trip down the lost highway of my mind.Private rant here: Where the H was the media circus that would have surrounded Getty's release from prison.

In the 2nd half, about 2/3 of the annoucements of who was about to sing what left the name of the opera off.

Clearly someone just slapped together a lot of old TV clips the quickest way they could, put the thing in a box and stuck an outrageous price on it.  That's the bad part.

I discovered opera though an LP set of hers in 1967, I have almost all her recordings, and my love is now dead.  Sutherland (phooey on the same reviewer who gave Callas the axe) was glorious, particularly in the fragment from Lucia.  Where were the microphones in that boring outdoor scene with Farrell (and was the applause canned)?

His absolute love for the game, although he took no measures to keep himself in shape to play.4. His rollercoaster of emotions as his career and his personal life took ups and downs, from signing the biggest deal in baseball and creating &quot;The House that Ruth Built,&quot; to physical confrontations with the fans who jeered him.5. His devotion to children, especially those who were orphaned such as he was. He took them for rides in his car, he brought shoes to them in the orphanage.6. The painful realization that his career was over as he walked off the field for the last time with his head down, to the standing ovation of the home crowd.This is a vast expanse of characterizations, and Goodman covered them all. True, he did have to lose weight to play the Babe. He dropped down to 275 pounds. That's only 15 pounds more than Babe usually weighed when he reported to spring training after an offseason of indulging in food, booze and women. He would play his way down to 240 pounds by the end of the season, but he was still 20 pounds overweight. Just think how many home runs he would have hit if he had the work ethic of a Lou Gehrig, a Nolan Ryan, a Mike Schmidt or a Roger Clemens.Sure, Goodman had a washerwoman swing at times during the movie. But, keep in mind that he is &quot;right&quot; handed and is performing with his left. I am very right handed, and when I try to throw with my left hand, I look deformed.To those who glorify Babe Ruth, this movie may be a shocker, but it told the truth. He loved the game, and he loved to live the wild life. Ultimately, it shortened his career by a few years.Goodman is great as the Bambino! Not only can he do comedy (he is totally hilarious in Rozanne), but he can do good dramatical roles if given the right piece, such as in this movie.

1564725,B008JFUQZ2,A1VF0102Z9VITO,0,0,2014-01-12,What a summer blockbuster should be!,"Pacific Rim is one of those summer blockbusters that I regretted not making more of an effort to see on the big screen. It's clearly designed for the big screen, featuring gigantic monsters (called kaiju and similar to King Kong, Godzilla, and the classic Japanese movie monsters) and robots (called jaeger, though they are much larger than any Transformers or other such big screen robots) who battle in the waters and the great cities of the Pacific Ocean. Everything is larger than life.The story follows jaeger pilot Raleigh Becket who fights a kaiju near Alaska. In the battle, the brother is torn from the jaeger they co-pilot and he dies. Since they pilot the machine through a psychic link (which doesn't make a lot of sense but is a dramatic contrivance to make the movie more exciting) he experiences his brother's death more deeply. Raleigh retires from piloting and becomes a drifter, working on the gigantic fences being built on Pacific coastlines to stop the kaiju from attacking. He's called back to piloting when the jaeger program is on its last legs. Marshall Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) runs the program and wants to make one last ditch effort to close the rift in the bottom of the Pacific from which the kaiju are emerging. Raleigh needs a new partner and the respect of the other jaeger pilots if the mission is to be a success.The story is fairly boiler-plate and the characters are not very deep at all. The real enjoyment of the movie is seeing the jaegers and the kaiju fighting in Hong Kong or in the ocean or under the ocean in the finale where they try to close the rift. The movie delivers in spades on this front. The kaiju are imaginative and make a great menace. The robots are as big as buildings and tear through property and kaiju with amazing visuals. Gone are the days of guys in rubber Godzilla suits trashing models of Tokyo. This movie looks great. Also, the design of the kaiju and the jaegers are a departure for del Toro, whose work is often very recognizable--Cronos, the Hellboy movies, Pan's Labyrinth, and a few other of his previous works definitely have a similar aesthetic which is not continued in Pacific Rim.The movie also keeps a good sense of humor. It doesn't take itself too seriously and finds plenty of light moments. There are nice visual references to other previous works like Jurassic Park and Voltron and other genre classics. Unlike World War Z, these references are fleeting and fun--not a distraction but a grin. Much like Rise of the Planet of the Apes, this movie is a lot better than I was expecting. I recommend it as good popcorn-munching fun. This is what a summer blockbuster is supposed to be like.",4.0,0.0,2,12,0.636,very positive,0.9928,very positive,2014,1,12

But someone finally did tell me what was up, and I finally did check it out. Anyway...It's weird that CHARRO! happens to be one of my favorite Elvis Presley movies, and I do wonder how much of my liking it has to do with Elvis's straying from formula. His films generically equated to fun but shallow musicals in which our boy trotted out that clean cut image. He's done westerns before and even pretty decent ones (LOVE ME TENDER, FLAMING STAR), but those aren't as redolent with sweat and grit as CHARRO!Ex-outlaw Jess Wade's try at going straight is curtailed when his old gang finally catches up with him, and head bandit Vince Hackett (Victor French) has come up with a truly messed-up punishment. Hackett shows Wade the treasured national artifact he'd shanghaied from the Mexican government, this in the shape of a gleaming gold-plated victory cannon. Hackett then tells Wade that wanted posters are circulating both sides of the border which implicate Wade as one of the thieving culprits. The posters indicate that one surefire way to identify Wade is thru that horrific wound on his neck. Except that Wade doesn't have that telltale wound. Not until now when Hackett brands his neck with a hot iron. Only then does he set Wade free, with a parting sneery caution that the Mexican federales are hot on his trail.The novelty extends to Elvis not performing any musical numbers, excepting the title track he sings off-screen over the opening credits. Then again, singing ditties really would have undermined the hard-bitten, resentful character he was playing (Picture him going ""What!? You don't believe I'm innocent? Here, let me sway you with this nifty rock & roll. Ah-huh-huh.""). I do wonder if I'd still appreciate this movie as much if Elvis weren't in it. When all's said and done, this is a fairly pedestrian spaghetti western, obviously trying to cash in from them iconic shoot-'em-ups so popularized by Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone. But the screenplay here is pretty much of the plain variety, the direction is meh. The score achieves a strident flourish for too many moments, even the undeserving moments, even when nothing so exciting is happening onscreen. Elvis taming that wild stallion? Sure, bring on the rousing soundtrack. But Elvis watering his horse and then casually riding away? No, ease up on the soundtrack, brother! The love interest, Ina Balin, looks ravishing (check her out right after her bath), except that she's under duress from a thankless role. One fun act, though, is Solomon Sturges's (son of director Preston Sturges) contribution as the twitchy, cackling younger Hackett brother. Sturges is over-the-top bananas, and he livens things up.Maybe I'm so taken with Elvis's atypical role here - he rarely ever got the dramatic role - that I really can't tell if his acting is good or bad. I just know that beard of his seems to shift density from scene to scene. Is Elvis stoic? Perhaps subliminating his character's inner rage? Or is it woeful acting? I couldn't tell you. I only know that I like it when he's onscreen. I only know that, to me, he comes off as a convincing gunfighter. I just haven't ever, ever seen him before in a grungy stubble. Also, throughout the film, makeup renders his complexion sweaty and clammy, and there's a sense that the man may even possibly smell bad. It's sure a far cry from his dashing, deodorant-applying playboy days in films like CLAMBAKE and GIRLS! GIRLS! GIRLS!, and that's why this movie is so very interesting to watch. 3.5 out of 5 stars for CHARRO!",4.0,0.0,10,1,-0.765,very negative,0.9931,very positive,2010,6,23

No denying it is one of Disney's best. It is appalling to think they could not spend a little money to clean up the quality of the picture. The sound seemed okay, but could use some improvement. The picture and color was spotted and slightly grainy especially at the beginning of the movie. I had read reviews here and knew it wasn't going to be good but I bought it anyway because I am hoping that when Disney has seen the interest in their old movies they may go back and clean them up and make better releases. Most of the older Disney movies have been restored or reprinted from better copies. Two movies, ""The Journey of Natty Gann"" and this one are very poor quality transfers. Unless you don't have a copy on VHS or you just want even a poor quality picture of this movie you may want to wait. Personally I did not want to wait since it may be years before Disney studios come to their senses and restore all their classic live action movies before putting them on DVD. This DVD does not include any extras either.The story is a good one with a great cast, camera work, and music. When a young man dreams about climbing mountains like his father, he finds it tough to prove himself. Our hero Rudi's father was killed on the mountain by an avalanche while guiding another climber. The whole towns guides have not climbed ""The Citadel"" for fifteen years since. When Rudi convinces his Uncle to let him climb as a porter, his chances of proving himself improve. Unfortunately he put his own wants above the climbing party and it almost leads to disaster. When he later puts the welfare of another guide over his dreams of reaching the top, he truly proves how worthy he has become. I would have given this movie five stars but I took one star off for Disney being so inconsiderate and not restoring this fine movie. If you are willing to suffer the poor picture quality, it is a great mountain climbing movie. If you liked ""The Mountain"" with Spencer Tracy and Robert Wagner, you will probably enjoy this one too. One can only hope they reproduce this after restoring it and even include some interviews or even a documentary about the mountains climbing history. Is anyone else as confused as me as to why Disney sits on a goldmine of classic movies and yet they either don't even put them on DVD or when they do they don't even have a consistant quality control?",4.0,0.9333333333333332,8,1,-0.4767,negative,0.9957,very positive,2006,2,18
704677,B000068MAQ,A2Y1D9287MGNQ4,2,3,2003-01-15,"Funny, but has some issues worth thinking about","The essence of Strawberry Eggs is quite simple: a recent college graduate becomes a junior high gym teacher by pretending to be a woman--the principal detests men and won't hire them.  The situation is not all that fresh, and the jokes revolve around exactly what you would expect them to (and are similar to every other cross-dressing show ever made, I imagine).  Nonetheless, it is quite funny.  At times, it tries to be heartwarming and whatnot; this largely fails, because it tries too hard and becomes cloying.  That's a fairly minor criticism.There are, however, two significant issues with this show--not problems, per se, but worth considering.  One is there is a high degree of &quot;fanservice&quot;--e.g., skirts lifting up in the wind, girls in various states of undress (no nudity though).  The particular focus of the fanservice is the main female character Fuko, and it's vaguely disturbing, as Fuko seems too immature to even be in junior high.  If the girls were older or there were less fanservice, that disturbing aspect would be gone.My second criticism applies to the English dub.  The acting itself is very good, but the decision-making in the translation is poor.  Many Japanese words are left untranslated, so that the English actors use the Japanese words for, among other things, the girls' gym clothes.  Some of the jokes are untranslated, such that if you don't know Japanese, you won't understand even if you're watching the dub.  Also left in are honorifics--suffixes added to the ends of names to show various relationships (e.g., adding -chan to the end of the name would normally convey affection).  Honorifics don't exist in English, and their presence makes the English lines disjointed.  It just feels like the translator didn't bother to translate 10% of the script.On the whole, this first disc of Strawberry Eggs is good, but has significant issues you might want to think about before buying.",4.0,0.6666666666666666,1,1,0.5106,positive,0.6596,very positive,2003,1,15

As someone who worked within the federal bureaucracy for decades, I can readily verify that those aspects depicting the inner workings of the Central Intelligence Agency are certainly accurate and on point in this new film with Robert Redford and Brad Pitt.  Pitt plays an agent who possibly has gone rogue, and who has been taken prisoner by the Chinese. Redford plays his former handler, now re-engaged to decipher Pitt's action on the day of his own retirement, who smells something foul in the skunk works at the last moment of his own incumbency, and starts playing double-dare internal spy games with other CIA officers within the facility who seem to have some hidden ulterior motive for wanting to throw Pitt's character to the wolves.Of course, one does well to recognize Redford's masterful hand in all this activity, since he has a well-earned reputation for questioning the nature of our intelligence agencies, their inbred culture of gamesmanship, and the way they work. Like spy thriller author John LeCarre (The Constant Gardener), Redford seems most interested in exploring the darker side of the so-called invisible government and its corrosive effect on the character of the men who populate it, and in the first hour or so, the film builds the tension between someone who wants to do right thing by an agent in the field and an agency looking to protect its own political agendas. As a result, Redford starts going out onto that precarious limb he had long ago advised Pitt never to venture onto, and learns some things about himself in the process.The truth is revealed in layers of deceit and games, and one has to keep his wits about him in understanding why Redford takes some of the actions he does and what the agency is doing in the meantime. Yet at the conclusion all is clear, and the standoff ends with Redford driving his older Porsche off into the sunset of his own career and a much different future than he had imagined just a day or so before. Pitt plays his own part quite well as an iconoclastic recruit who learns enough about himself and the spy-game to understand there has to be a better and more purposeful way to live. This for me is the real strength of the movie, and the understated message Redford wants us to get; Our intelligence agencies work in service to goals often so twisted and altered from their original purpose as to be preposterous monsters, yet such conduct is all too common within the framework of how they operate. This is a cautionary tale told with purpose; to convince us the game is out of control.",4.0,0.9090909090909092,1,1,0.0,neutral,0.9899,very positive,2002,6,4

A satisfying movie for guys who like movies with explosions, throat punches, machine guns and knife fights.  It's like one super-long action sequence.Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler; Machine Gun Preacher, Gamer) was transferred from the Secret Service after an accident resulted in the death of President Asher's (Aaron Eckhart) wife.  He's bored of his new desk job and misses being by his friend the president's side.  But the president cannot bear the memory of his wife's death.During a meeting in the White House, the South Korean Prime Minister's chief of security Kang  goes rogue.  He is actually a long dark-ops North Korean terrorist with sinister plans for the United States. Rick Yune (The Man with the Iron Fists, Ninja Assassin) really owns the role of Kang and his ""no foolin' around"" hard line of terrorism.Kang's White House takeover gives audiences a lot of continuous, intense action.  There are suicide bombers, huge guns, rapid fire guns, a kamikaze air assault, missile strikes, missile decoys, smoke bombs, explosions, creative road blocks, terrorists in tourists' clothing and insider double-crosses--it drew a lot of laughs, smiles and ""ooohs"" from the action movie fans in the audience.  The White House lawn was painted red as somehow Banning snuck his way into the White House before Kang's men had complete control.Making his entrance, Banning watched in horror as secret service agents, responding to the sound of loads of gunfire, recklessly ran out into the open through the front door and were mowed down by Gatling guns.  For the sake of an impressive body count, the writers seemed to have decided that secret service men an White House security details are rather poorly trained and have no concept of using cover or evasive maneuvers when under fire.  This was a blaring flaw and it came with a lot of ""OMG, REALLY!?!""  But it also made it fun.With the president and vice president held hostage, House Speaker Turnbull (Morgan Freeman) assumes the pressures of acting president.  As Turnbull weighs Kang's threats with global security, Banning starts wading his way through the White House halls and BRUTALLY picking off Kang's elite trained operatives.  The hand-to-hand combat isn't quite what I'd prefer, filmed very close up, sometimes shaky, and with choppy one-cut-per-move editing.  But hey, this isn't a martial arts movie.  It's a series of super-long action sequences kind of movie.  And the hard hitting action sequences are quite pleasing to this action junkie!Supporting actors include Angela Bassett as Banning's boss, Melissa Leo as the Defense Secretary and Radha Mitchell as Banning's wife.  Everyone did a fine job.  My biggest complaint wouldn't be with the acting, but the writing in the early scenes when we have the president's healthy happy family routine shoved down our throats.  Too many rainbows and not enough ""real.""  But, again, this movie is largely a continuous IV drip of action.  So I'll let it slide.Director Antoine Fuqua (Shooter, King Arthur, Training Day) must have anticipated how bad A Good Day to Die Hard was going to be and decided to give us ""Die Hard in the White House"" starring Gerard Butler to make up for it.  In fact, this movie was stunningly similar to the awesomely epic Die Hard and Live Free or Die Hard.  Let me count the ways...  1) The calm, cool, collected Kang looked so sleek in his vest outfit, not unlike the dashing and dapper, cardiganed Timothy Olyphant.  2) Like the Maggie Q to Olyphant, Kang also had a tough Asian computer whiz at his side who could hold her own in a fight.  3)  Like Willis' John MacClane, Butler takes a beating in this movie and his bruises and blood don't magically disappear between scenes as he takes heavy doses of punishment.  4) Like MacClane in Die Hard, Banning is the only line of communication with the outside, it takes a while for Kang to realize he's even there, Kang and Banning exchange some smack talk and threats, a bad guy pretends to be a good guy to try to kill Banning, and when the acting president and his panel don't listen to Banning bad stuff happens.  5) Banning and his wife are also having some problems--classic MacClane!  Basically, this movie was Die Hard with a North Korean Timothy Olyphant and Maggie Q in the White House.Is this a bad thing?  Hell, no!  I enjoyed it.  It was a fun.

On its own, the movie is pretty good. The scenery is well done; Gere does the role of Lance A Lot quite well. (He makes him a strong and able knight who lacks discipline in certain areas, and is governed by sexual desire more than anything else.)  Connery is great as King Arthur. (He is very well mannered and disciplined, he is a capable and effective king,  when he discovers his wife's infidelity, he explodes, but he does regain his mental stability to probe the matter, and he spends his final moments fighting for his people.) Cross (the villain) is really wicked and cruel, but he does carry charm, and he is even  likable at times! I suspect Merlin was deleted to remove elements of possible implausibility.

1067367,B000OYCMLM,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,3,7,2008-02-10,Behind the Screams,"Making a horror movie is tricky, thankless business.  The older you get, the harder it is to find a truly scary film.  Maybe this is just a function of age; watch a movie at the age of thirty that scared the bejeezus out of you at age thirteen, and you may find yourself wondering what the teenage you was thinking.  Maybe, also, it's simply a matter of unoriginal and uncreative filmmaking.  Horror movies stand almost no chance at all of winning any kind of serious awards or acclaim, so their aspirations are limited, and most of the time they try to bank on the things that have worked before, and over and over again.  It's a safe bet to say that the bulk of horror writers/directors are no longer interested in actually trying to frighten their smirking audiences.  Instead, the genre has devolved into two basic factions: gross-out movies (seethe Saw trilogyor either of theHostels) where all of the creative energy is focused on finding new and interesting ways to slaughter peoiple, or movies that run on pure snark.BEHIND THE MASK andHack!are NOT scary movies, nor were they meant to be.  If you have any doubts about this, they are dispelled from the first frames of both films.  Both flicks were written and produced in the same spirit of cheeky playfulness, and both of them work in direct proportion to the number of horror movie references the viewer is able to catch.  These are not horror films; they are homages.BEHIND THE MASK is the smarter of the two, which also means it's the talkier one.  Capitalizing on the supernatural serial killer subset of horror films, BEHIND THE MASK seeks to show the genesis of a new killer: Leslie Vernon.  Jason, Freddy, Michael -- the movie demythologizes the dark, demonic roots of these unstoppable murderers by analyzing in detail just what it takes to become one of them.  Leslie, in the midst of his training in terror, has agreed to allow a documentary film crew follow him around as he plans and schemes his reign of blood.  With the help of a mentor (a nicely underplayed Scott Wilson), Leslie sets in motion all of the tried and true totems of any good horror movie: the target virgin, the Ahab (who, in this case, is a straight-faced Robert Englund), the drunken frat boys.  He even expounds on all the ways ""invincible"" killers manage to stay alive, keep their quarry in line, and (seemingly) be in two places at once.It's a remarkably smart film (my favorite is the deleted scene where Leslie proves that he can, like all hellish fiends, catch up to someone in a foot race without ever actually running).  The film mostly has the faded, grainy quality of the documentary camera, but when Leslie is about to accomplish another horror movie cliche, it changes to the sharp, pre-planned film shots of your average scary movie.  It's a trade-off that's both rewarding and funny; after successfully navigating through another of creepdom's old chestnuts, Leslie grins and dances and jabbers his excitement to the documentarian.  Not the behavior you imagine from a supernatural serial killer, but these are his off-hours.The film is not without its flaws.  It tries to be a little too smart, and stumbles over its own set-up.  The film crew that's following Leslie begins to feel compunctions about documenting the murder of innocent teens and librarians, and they start getting involved in the action.  This turn of events throws back at the audience the concessions they've already been asked to make, but it also gives the movie a chance to really explore the outer limits of its truisms.  It takes a sharp eye to catch 100% of what BEHIND THE MASK is doing, and some might not think it's worth the effort.  Still, it's at least as clever as any other horror film you might find out there, even if it's not as scary.BEHIND THE MASK and HACK! are both homages, but HACK! is more openly satirical.  It doesn't go whole hog with the parody until the last fifteen minutes, when the script's self-deprecation becomes equally self-congratulatory, but it doesn't take a viewer of much discernment to see the gears at work in the opening scenes.  The dialogue and acting are so incredibly awful, they're funny in a way that must be intentional.  And, again, audiences educated in horror movie lore should catch dozens and dozens of filmic references, some of them overt, some of them less so.  It's basically what you would get if the makers ofThe Simpsonssat down to write a scary movie.That comparison isn't an accident.  A group of inanely stereotypical college students travels to a secluded island as part of some ludicrously vague field trip.  Among the island's inhabitants is a Scottish groundskeeper named Willy (played perfectly by William Forsythe).  Also on the island: a young couple who are crazy about horror films.  The annoying students trade some of the cheesiest banter in movie history, take part in a few gratuitously nude scenes, and get dispatched in gory but decidedly unscary moments.  The characters don't hesitate to announce (over and over) that they feel like they're living in a cliched horror movie.The only real problem with HACK! is that it works so hard to be cheesy and stupid that it ends up being legitimately cheesy and stupid.  The denoument is the smartest and cleverest thing about the film, when the dialogue gets some punch and when the reflective veneer of the script shines its brightest, but before this you must endure some of the lamest scenes ever committed to horror-film.  True, the scenes are self-consciously lame, but that doesn't make them any less of a chore to watch.  There's only so many times an audience can roll its eyes before its eyes get tired of rolling.I applaud the effort, though.  Much like BEHIND THE MASK, HACK! turns its final screws during the credits, and provides at least enough giggles to partially make up for the lack of screams the genre as a whole has failed to create in recent years.  At the very least, both films give due credit to the fans they honor.  Horror movies may have gotten pretty stupid in recent years, both flicks seem to say, but that doesn't mean the audiences have, too.",4.0,0.4285714285714285,3,2,-0.296,negative,-0.9668,very negative,2008,2,10

Upon a second viewing, however, I noticed things I hadn't before. Like to overdone romance that borders on Hollywood-cheesy.The film itself is a marvel of modern technology. While some of the computer effects look artificial, there are some spectacular scenes, especially the whole sinking sequence, which takes up nearly a quarter of the movie. I will say that this is the best part of the movie (much like in Pearl Harbor, where the attack is the best).The love story that is so central to this movie is well done and never really feels contrived. The meeting between Jack (diCaprio) and Rose (Winslet) is clever and believable, and their feelings grow toward one another naturally and at a good pace. The length of the movie helps you develop feelings for the main characters, and you want their love to continue uninterrupted. However, you cannot help shaking your head at some of the scenes, such as the completely contrived &quot;I'm flying Jack, I'm flying&quot; scene at the bow of the ship. Please.Acting is superb, and it is through their roles in this film that diCaprio and Winslet became famous (diCaprio furthering his Hollywood stardom, and Winslet gaining recognition worldwide). Zane plays the part of the selfishly arrogant fiancee very convincingly, and you find yourself rooting against him throughout the film. The costumes and set decorations are very authentic, and through these the fated ship and its passengers come to life on the screen.There are a lot of people out there that look at this film as a chick flick and refuse to see it because it gushes romantic. I understand why this would be so; this film is intended to be a love story based around a tragic, historical event, and it does a good job. A word of warning, however. The movie tends to border on the melodramatic a good deal of the time, and there is a fair amount of absurdly over-romantic scenes. Jack and Rose can't seem to love each other outside of a soap-opera, yet you find yourself wanting them to succeed despite this.In short, this is an entertaining movie, worth watching if you have an interest in history as it brings the past alive. If you don't like romance, just skip to the last third of the movie, when the boat bites the bullet, and you shouldn't be too disappointed.",4.0,0.0,1,4,0.4823,positive,0.9969,very positive,2001,5,31

This is the time period from 1986-1996 that rarely disappoints. Our selection this time was Pinocchio's Revenge. This film was made in 1996, so it is right on the cusp time-wise. And judging by the cover, we knew this was a terrible film, so we were a little worried that it might have a littleJack Frostin it. By this we mean that the people in charge of the production knew the movie was irredeemable, so they threw in some comedy in the way of corny one-liners just to hedge their bets. But we lucked out when this flick actually tried to be good and scary. Of course it wasn't, so the only comedy came from us ripping it apart at a rate even we aren't usually capable of. Perfect. The result was the very essence of horror B. There aren't even any recognizable actors in this one except for Randolph, the butler from Wedding Crashers and Asian Reporter Trisha Takinawa.Pinocchio's Revenge is a pretty self-explanatory title. The film centers around a doll who is devoid of all reason, all logic. In fact, it compels a man to become a mass child murderer. His lawyer suspects that the Pinocchio doll the killer made for his son is ultimately responsible for the murders, but can't prove it. So she mistakingly brings the doll home. Pretty big error, wouldn't you burn that thing asap? To make matters worse, she piles it on to her daughter's birthday presents, then lets the little girl keep it. By this point, you're hoping you see Pinocchio flogging Mom within the next 5 minutes. From here, the writing is on the wall. Pinocchio starts corrupting the girl, and she starts acting strange. She gets into a fight at school which is just pure cinematic genius. And all these bizarre accidents start happening, including a bus running the girl over. But don't worry, she bounced right back up and walked away without an explanation as to how. So, the little girl ices her classmate and her mom's boyfriend. But was it her or Pinocchio? That's what is in question at the end. What is not in question, however, is that this movie is the true essence of B.The fact that they only had enough budget to have one scene in which the puppet's mouth moved seals the deal. Then throw in the Journey to the West level acting from the foreign chick that Pinocchio watched shower, and you go up another star for atrocious acting as well as a totally gratuitous nude scene. Also, when the puppet's eyes moved in a decidedly Short Studd manner we couldn't believe it. We were actually on the fence of 2 1/2 to 3 stars at one point during this flick. But, then it happened. They showed Pinocchio running across the street.  It was the spitting image of Sid chasing a chick down with a pink turkey baster. That's an instant 4-star effort. But, after a little research, we found out that it wasn't the late, great L DeJ in his final role as we guessed. It was Verne Troyer. Yep, a good 3 years before his role as Mini-me and about 10 years before his legendary Surreal Life stint, he was a stunt double for an inanimate object. Too bad they had him running instead of riding around on that little scooter of his.If you are looking for some scares and legitimate creepiness, this is not the movie for you. But, if it's an hour and a half of mocking something  that your 8 year old could have come up with you enjoy like us, Pinocchio's Revenge is perfect for you. It fits the definition of unintentional comedy to a ""T"" therefore, it is an obvious choice for a Sid the Elf recommendation.

Minnie Driver plays the role of Grace to perfection, from her earlier sick and dying scenes, to starting to embrace life as she is given a second chance to live.  Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi as Grace's best friends do a flawless job, and steal almost every scene that they are in.The tone of the movie never gets too heavy handed, and the strong performances manage to keep the flow of the movie going without bogging it down too much.

371698,6303393985,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,4,5,2013-12-30,(BLU RAY REVIEW) 3 1/2 stars for another good film from 1939,"This dramatic western tells the ""true"" story of how Jesse James went from a young farmer to outlaw.  I use the word ""true"" hesitantly as there is little historical accuracy, by all accounts, past the character's names.  Putting that aside, director Henry King and an uncredited Irving Cummings have presented a pretty darn good western.In this story (screenplay by Nunnally Johnson), Jesse (Tyrone Power) and brother Frank (Henry Fonda) are young farmers in Missouri.  Living with their mother (Jane Darwell), their property is in the way of the evil railroad and those that work for it.  In what was probably true, the railroad men and a skunk named Barshee (Brian Donlevy) have been arm-twisting the land owners to sell their property to the railroad for well below market prices.  The James boys and mom want no part of it.  When Barshee and his trio of henchmen decide to start twisting Frank's arm, Barshee gets his butt kicked.  When his back is turned, Frank is about to get wacked with a scythe by Barshee.  Jesse shows up just in time to shoot Barshee in the hand.Barshee files charges and figuring they can't fight the railroad, the boys head for the hills.  This turns the boys into outlaws and in retribution for the mother's death, they decide to take it out on the railroad.  Their holdups are polite enough as they want no jewelry, just cash.  And as they depart, Jesse and Frank tell the victims to be sure to file a claim with the railroad.  They are obligated to reimburse passengers.The townsfolk are sympathetic as well.  Especially the newspaper publisher, Maj. Cobb (Henry Hull) and his niece Zee (nicely played by Nancy Kelly).  Zee is also the girlfriend and soon to be wife of Jesse.  Randolph Scott plays Will Wright, a U. S. Marshal.  He's also on the boy's side, but has little to do but be a shoulder for Zee to lean on.  Will has a hankerin' for Zee, but she has eyes for nobody but Jesse.  John Carradine plays that ""dirty little coward, Bob Ford,"" who (spoiler alert) eventually guns down Jesse, shooting him in the back.The acting and some terrific stunts involving horses make the film worth searching out.  Power was at the height of his hunky stardom, but Fonda steals all the scenes he's in.  Watch him in a confrontation with Jesse as Jesse is about to lose it.  Also there is a nifty scene when Jesse and Frank, surrounded in a failed bank robbery jump their horses through a store window.  There is another where horses and riders go flying off a cliff into the river.  Recommended.The Blu ray transfer comes in 1080p resolution with a 1.37:1 aspect ratio.  The picture suffers a bit because of the age and the fact that technicians didn't have an original print.  Some of the colors may appear washed out, but I still found the picture highly watchable.  I would also add that there were no significant artifacts in the picture which looked nicely detailed and problem free.  You have the option of selecting a DTS-HD Master Audio mono track or 5.1 surround.  I opted for the 5.1 but aside from the musical score and some galloping horses, not much was going on in the surrounds.  Still, dialog was clear and properly located.  Extras are minimal with only a trailer, a Movietone clip featuring Ed Sullivan giving an award to Power and a 30 second clip of a premier in Connecticut (I think).",4.0,0.8,9,1,0.4404,positive,-0.2171,negative,2013,12,30
93439,0790729733,A2ZR5EUYPX69CB,4,4,2000-02-17,Stone isn't the gospel-but neither is the Warren Report...,"The movie JFK is in effect a who-done-it without telling you who-done-it. Oliver Stone gives us the story of New Orleans DA Jim Garrison in his quest to convict businessman Clay Shaw of conspriacy to assassinate President  John F. Kennedy in Dallas. However, Garrison's case against Shaw was never  strong. Truth be told, I myself am not a believer that Mr. Shaw had  anything to do with President Kennedy's death on November 22, 1963. With  that said, there are other factors in this motion picture which do offer  more than a few redeemable gems. Lee Oswald's very dubious movements in  Russia, New Orleans, and Mexico for one. The hostility of the CIA toward  the Kennedy White House, and the Agency's involement with the Mafia to  assassinate Cuba's Castro. The highly implausible saga of the Single Bullet  Theory. And the strange behavior of the Dr. Humes for burning the original  autopsy draft. Factors such as this, to name a few, have put a great strain  on the Warren Report's conclusion that Oswald did it- and did it alone.  Criticisms towards the Report have been around for years prior to the movie  JFK. Yet it was this movie that brought these critical factors to the  national stage and a new generation. History NEED NOT say JFK be the  definative word for the  killing of John Kennedy.  But the Warren Report  CAN'T make that claim either. The Government went into the investigation of  President Kennedy's death with a preconceived notion that Oswald was to be  blamed, and the presentation of evidence was to show that end-and that end  alone. The Comission was bullied by the Johnson White House to finish the  investigation before the 64 election. The &quot;autopsy&quot; the Comission  used to prove it's case was a shambles. The CIA's deception to the  Comission on assassination plots with the Mafia on Fidel Castro only adds  to the Warren Report's investigative impotence. True, Oliver Stone's movie  is a mixture of fact and fiction, that is clear. However, it does  illustrate key facts to the case which the Warren Comission failed-or  refused-to cover. That by itself makes this movie worthy of the four stars  I give it. But proceed with caution, dear reader: Be aware that this film,  like so many people's take on the death of John Kennedy, is a blend of  history and opinion. Watch the movie, but also watch your step...",4.0,1.0,1,6,0.0,neutral,-0.9801,very negative,2000,2,17

After reading the comic, there is nothing in the movie that was drawn from this 'Year One' storyline, other than the premise that it shows Batman in the starting years. These issues do not account for Bruce Wayne's 7 year absence, do not refer to any training, does not mention Rha Al Ghul, and spends half the time centered on a young lieutenant Gordon who has just arrived in Gotham.To review this movie, I wanted to know how true it was to the comic book. And having read the Year One storyline, I still do not know. Having said that, this is probably the best Batman movie made. It establishes a more serious, darker insight into the character. More true to the modern era of Batman, not the kiddie stuff we grew up with in the 70s. It was interesting to see Batman's training, and the rationale as to why a man would want to become a bat.Cristian Bale is great, and I'm glad to hear he has signed up to do more movies.

596637,B00005JL8F,A10WCSGF78M2KE,16,22,2002-05-31,"Good, but familiar....","Jack Ryan isn't getting older. And he isn't getting better. He's getting younger and he's turned into Ben Affleck, who is probably as good as Alec Baldwin (Ryan No. 1) but can't hope to match the crusty cool of Harrison Ford (Ryan No. 2).The latest Ryan movie, ""The Sum of All Fears,"" is based on Tom Clancy's sixth novel, written in 1991. The chronology may strike the casual observer as a bit skewed. Apparently, ""Sum"" is a kind of prequel that takes Ryan back to his days as a feckless CIA rookie. It shows him merely dating Cathy (Bridget Moynahan), who will become his future wife (Anne Archer in the Ford films).Yet, this movie is taking place in the present and that would mean...Oh, never mind. Let's all do the Time Warp again and let it go.Anyway, Ryan is a greenhorn analyst whose particular expertise - he wrote a paper on a Russian official named Alexander Nemerov(Ciaran Hinds) - is now in great demand because Nemerov has just become the new president of Russia. Recruited by CIA director William Cabot (Morgan Freeman), Ryan quickly finds himself behind some very powerful closed doors, talking strategy with President Fowler (a very credible James Cromwell) and his top aides (Philip Baker Hall, Ron Rifkin and Bruce McGill).Meanwhile, a neo-Nazi (Alan Bates) has acquired a nuclear bomb, which he plans to use to start a war between Russia and the U.S. The idea is first to detonate the bomb at the Super Bowl in Baltimore, which the President is attending, and then rachet up the tension until the U.S. is convinced Nemerov is on the attack, and the two countries blow each other into oblivion.The bomb goes off - a harrowing sequence depicting a supposed low-level ""dirty bomb"" done in desaturated colors that shows us a very bleak Baltimore - isn't what the movie is about; it's about the aftermath. The confusion (particularly at the highest levels of government), the terror and, especially, the compassion as everyone tries to take care of everyone else.Which, of course, echoes the confusion, terror and compassion that really happened on Sept. 11. That shocking moment in history is inevitably intertwined with any movie offering this kind of scenario. It may be too soon for some to watch.It may be just right for others. The nine months distance does help. Our collective horrified memory - and remember, this movie was finished befire 9/11 - gives some considerable emotional heft to what would otherwise be another routinely professonal Clancy thriller. This time last year, the idea of a a nuclear explosion in Baltimore would strike the average viewer as unlikely, as far-fetched as a killer meteor. Now such an event has a chilling possibility. Something very close to it has already happened and seeing it imagined gives the picture a resonance it could never have summoned on its own.""The Sum of All Fears"" is more of an ensemble piece than earlier Ryan adventures. Freeman continues to be a magic ingredient for any movie - like adding butter and sugar to most recipes. Cromwell brings dignity and humanity to a familiar part. After the explosion, he's not only enraged that someone attacked America but that ""they tried to kill me."" Liev Schreiber shows up as an expert field operative (originally played by Willem Dafoe). Typically a cerebral actor, he's surprisingly convincing in an action role.As for Affleck, he really isn't bad. His comic exchanges with Freeman are delightful and he can carry off the square-jawed-hero bit when called upon. But as movies like the recent ""Changing Lanes"" showed, he has a deft semi-comic touch. He should be playing some of the roles Hugh Grant turns down. The director, Phil Alden Robinson (""Field of Dreams""), isn't a conventional action director, but he handles the end-of-the-world stuff well. Plus, he brings a much-needed human dimension to the characters.Early Summer 2002 is shaping up to be all about comic-book heroes and George Lucas fantasies. That makes a good ol' Hollywood action flick even more welcome. ""The Sum of All Fears"" may not be super-smart, but it's rock-solid. And a fine way to spend a few hours out of the summer heat.",4.0,0.7272727272727273,1,1,0.2382,positive,0.9586,very positive,2002,5,31
687053,B00005V3Z4,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,8,10,2011-12-16,"Blu-ray: You may find Richard Kelly's ""Donnie Darko"" to be a complex but wonderful film or even a true masterpiece.","It has been ten years since ""Donnie Darko"" appeared in theaters and in within those ten years, fans of the film, people who watched and have appreciated the film continue to watch it over and over  and many still give their interpretations of what they think ""Donnie Darko"" is all about.  Many who have had differing opinions of the film especially with the release of the Director's Cut version of the film.But ""Donne Darko"" has a pretty considerable following and yes, has achieved cult status.Not surprising as ""Donnie Darko"" is one of those films that tends to mix reality, non-reality, time-travel and possibly a parallel universe to give a surreal film that people need to watch this film more than once.  And sure enough, with each viewing of the film, people tend to find certain things that they have never seen before.  And I have to agree because each time I watch this film, I always discover something different, something new.So, what is ""Donnie Darko""?""Donnie Darko"" is a film written and directed by Richard Kelly (""Domino"", ""The Box"", ""Southland Tales"") and while it was not successful in the box office (the film was budgeted at $4.5 million and took home $4.1 million), the film has done much better in home video release.In 2002, a DVD for the film was released.  Followed by the ""Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut"" 2004 DVD featuring 21 additional minutes of extra footage and new special features and in 2009, ""Donnie Darko"" was released on Blu-ray with both the Director's Cut and theatrical version of the film.And here we are with a 2011 Blu-ray release titled ""Donnie Darko: 10th Anniversary Edition"".  While pretty much the same release as what was released back in 2009, this edition includes the Blu-ray with both theatrical and Director's Cut release and the special features DVD from the popular 2005 Deluxe Edition release but also includes the original 2002 DVD that came with special features (which were not included on the Deluxe Edition or the 2009 Blu-ray release) and a digital copy of the film.VIDEO:""Donnie Darko: 10th Anniversary Edition"" is the same Blu-ray release from 2009.  Presented in 1080p High Definition (2:#5:1 aspect ratio), the picture quality is quite soft.  The film is not actually vibrant but there is clarity over the previous DVD release.  There is a good amount of grain and black levels are good.  But maybe its the original film elements but I did notice a good amount of noise as well.Overall, ""Donnie Darko"" (theatrical or Director's Cut) has good PQ and while not as vibrant or very detailed compared to modern releases on Blu-ray, the PQ for the film is good.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Donnie Darko: 10th Anniversary Edition"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  While dialogue and music is what comprises this film's lossless soundtrack, there are times where you hear immersive sound.  From the fall of the airplane engine on Donnie's bedroom, the sound of the worlmhole, the brooding sound of Frank or the sound of 80's music from Echo and the Bunnymen, Tears for Fears or INXS, the audio quality for the film is good but don't expect full immersion via the surround channels.  The film is primarily central and front channel driven!Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Spanish and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Donnie Darko: 10th Anniversary Edition"" comes with the following special features:Blu-ray:Audio Commentary with Writer/Director Richard Kelly and Director Kevin Smith (Director's Cut) - Actually, a very enjoyable commentary to hear these two filmmakers discuss the film.

And even if you do watch the theatrical version or even the Director's Cut, only those willing to rewatch and dissect the film, to piece together the various clues, will find the film to be quite entertaining.For me, I love films that make you think, I love films that have a lasting rewatch value because you tend to have different interpretations of what is going on and what is happening.  What is real?  What is not real?  Are we watching scenes from Donnie's perspective or reality?  Or is it a parallel, alternate timeline?Needless to say, this is not a film that will be easily accessible for those wanting a simple, formulaic storyline.  And to make things even more confusing is the inclusion of the Director's Cut which has scenes that further make the series a bit more confusing and different, that you either will prefer on or the other.Speaking of the Director's Cut, it's essentially almost like you are getting two different films.  The Director's Cut changes a few musical sequences and adds in other sequences that make you wonder why the Director added them but needless to say, the film was complex to begin with and now it's even made a bit more complex with the additional footage.  Especially the addition of the title cards showing the contents of the Philosophy of Time Travel.Personally, when I watched Donnie Darko, I just thought it was sick individual who didn't take his medication and what we are watching are neither reality but a figment of his imagination.  But then again, that would be too easy of an explanation.So, the next time I watched the film, I felt that perhaps there was  deeper meaning and almost what we see with those who have mental issues and end up hurting or murdering people because they have a problem with society, I often wondered because Donnie had so many issues of society, was always a challenge to authority, that perhaps it was his way of trying to free himself from society.  To conjure any thoughts of escaping the reality through time travel and in some way, while a smart individual, it's his inability to fit in that puts various situations in his mind.I often feel that there is also a message from Kelly that he felt towards society.  Where his sister is a dancer for Sparkle Motion, the parents put too much emphasis on their children to achieve but for the wrong reasons.  We see it at the beginning of the film when Rose is talking to her daughter about Harvard, we see Rose more concerned about Sam's dancing and the parents for the other children are no different.  And I felt that Kelly was trying to demonstrate how messed up society is because of this thinking.  That people are consumed by this culture that there are other things that that should be cared about but no one was willing to make that change.  But it's not just Donnie's parents, it also can be seen with the teacher (played by Drew Barrymore) and other adults where society is literally heading to darkness and decay and perhaps Donnie is the one to fix the world.But that leads me back to the people with mental problems who go on to hurt others.  In their head, they are also thinking they are trying to make the world a better place when in fact, no one sees them like that.  More like a cancer to society... the same can be seen with Donnie Darko, hero for a new generation or a cancer to society?Last but not least, there is almost a lax of parental authority. Children are free to cuss on the table, the father just laughs.  Donnie tells a teacher to shove something up her butt and his father just laughs.  And as for Frank, the demonic rabbit, this is Donnie's figment of his own imagination.  Think of it as the devil and angel on one's shoulders, telling them what to do and not do.  Well, remove that angel out of the equation and substitute that devil for a demonic rabbit.  The rabbit is the yearning of Donnie to be destructive because afterall, who will really care?And the irony of it all, is that destruction is going to happen but yet, Donnie seems to have found love during destruction and to see that love taken away.Of course, I have had several interpretations of this film over the last ten years.  It's an artistic expression that reminds me of a Picasso painting where you can see a painting that looks so off, so dark and bleak, but someone else can see it as light, vibrant and unique.  Donnie Darko is a film that is not mean to be understood 100%.  It's mean for the viewer to take what they got from the film and interpret it their way.  Some may find it complex, some may find it as a simply love story.  Some may find it as a film of sacrifice.  It's all subjective to the viewer.As for the Blu-ray release, unfortunately there is not much new aside from the downloadable digital copy that is included with this 10th anniversary of Blu-ray and the inclusion of the original 2002 DVD release.  Those hoping for a remaster or newer restoration are not going to find any changes from the 2009 Blu-ray release. But for those who have not purchased the 2009 edition on Blu-ray, then by all means, definitely give ""Donnie Darko: 10th Anniversary Edition"" a chance!  It's definitely worth checking out if you are open to creative, artistic and a different style of film.I have heard cinema fans who talk about how they disliked the film at first but now consider it a masterpiece.  I've read people who love intellectual films to surreal films but couldn't get into ""Donnie Darko"".  Suffice to say, people do have an opinion of it.  There is no doubt that ""Donnie Darko"" Is definitely a different kind of film and possibly one that didn't do well in the box office because of its unusual nature.  But to see how this film has grown its fanbase in the last decade is quite intriguing!Regardless of how my interpretation or others interpretation of the film may be.  Positive or negative...really, it doesn't matter because this is not your average film where one can watch once and give a definitive answer.

While Kouichi lives on one end of Kyuushuu with his mother and maternal grandparents, his brother lives at the other end with his father and his father's rock band. In class he hears a classmate's claim that the energy released by passing bullet trains will bring wishes to pass, so he decides to meet his brother half-way to see if his wish will come true.The side stories of his friends and his brother's friends who come along for the experiment give us a heart-warming look into the minds of innocent Japanese preteens. Subtle situational humor and dialog keep the slowly unfolding story engaging as we look into family, friendship and classroom dynamics. The young actors are at their most convincing when they share their wishes with each other in secrecy.I appreciate the fact that the film is touching without falling into schmaltz. There are no sappy, tear-jerking scenes or overly-idealistic portrayals of pure, noble characters. We have a film about ordinary people in nearly mundane situations. What may disappoint American viewers is the lack of a happy ending (or even a tying up of all the loose ends). If you expect a miracle at the end, you will not be satisfied.

Before they meet, Drew Barrymore's character has had some disappointments in life, but is basically content, and Hugh Grant's character is actually fairly happy, too, as he coasts along on the remnants of his past fame.  In other words, it wasn't a broad, high concept film along the lines of ""two broken people meet and heal each other's hurts"".  No, it was more like two quirky, likable people making their lives even better my meeting each other.And, once Hugh and Drew (love the way that sounds) meet and get along famously, there's no phony misunderstanding or contrived disagreement that they eventually need to overcome.  There's simply a feeling-out process with an awkward (and funny) moment or two along the way, and a touching conclusion as Hugh and Drew realize (as the audience has seen from the start) that their characters are quite a bit more than quirky friends who get along very well personally and professionally.  I guess I liked the fact that the talent behind the film trusted the audience not to need broad histrionics to get immersed in a film.Other plusses: the gentle fun poked at 80's pop culture (though I thought Hugh's ""80's"" pop hit, ""Pop Goes My Heart"" was actually kind of catchy), nicely developed supporting characters (Drew's sister and Hugh's manager are a lot of fun), and a handful of entertaining extras on the DVD, the medium that introduced me to this delightful film.In short, check out ""Music and Lyrics"".

Street smart and tough with a vulnerable side, Meg gets caught up in John's trouble when the crime boss sends a handful of thugs to shoot up her rat trap apartment and find that neither John, nor Meg, is going to take that lying down.The action is intense and sometimes a little comic book in its overkill, but the basic story is really good and the lead characters are good people in bad situations who make a choice to do the right thing and take on the consequences head on.I also like the fact that Meg, Mira Sorvino's character, isn't one of those 'wilt as soon as things get tough' types in this movie.  She's tough and she knows how to handle herself, not only duking it out but also using whatever weapons are available.  She doesn't need John to take care of her and she kicks as much butt as he does... well, maybe the headcount isn't quite equal, but still, she goes toe to toe with the bad guys and she's the one who walks away.It's a great movie about choice, guilt and redemption mixed in with the action.Definitely worth adding to your movie collection!",4.0,0.0,1,1,-0.6705,very negative,0.6318,very positive,2011,10,17

675824,B00005QW5S,A2OTX4X3895YXT,6,6,2003-07-29,Awesome 3D Really Works at Home (Finally!),"I've been a huge fan of 3D technology since I was a child.  I cut my 3D teeth on television broadcasts of ""Revenge of the Creature"" on our local television station.  Unfortunately, the 3D effects were quite muted or didn't work at all.  Then the 3D movies came back to the theaters (Friday the 13th in 3D, Jaws 3D, Parasite, Comin' at Ya!, etc.).  Many of these were R rated, so I couldn't get in to see the earlier ones.  However, the ones I DID see blew me away, especially because they used polarized lenses instead of the obnoxious blue/red lenses.Once the VHS revolution took place, you could find the odd 3D ""creature feature"" on tape.  The 3D effects on these were better than the broadcast versions of my childhood, but not much.  Finally, DVDs came along and upped the notch a bit with better resolution, but still, something was missing.  The 3D just ""kinda"" worked.NOW, however, we have the Imax-type ""shutter"" glasses for home use.  Incidentally, this is not new technology as you might guess:  The old Sega Master System videogame console of the early 80s had similar shutter glasses for it's line of 3D games.The shutter glasses (two pair) come bundled with this DVD box set, and FINALLY great home 3D has arrived!  The effects are truly amazing.  It's not without its faults, however.First off, although the company also makes WIRELESS glasses, this box set comes with the wired model.  Also, the three movies here are geared toward younger viewers.  All three movies are computer generated and most of them are filmed in dark environments.  There is a reason for this:  when brighter scenes are viewed, there is a noticeable ""flicker"".  This flickering is caused by the fact that each lens shutter is openning/closing rapidly (left lens  open/right lens closed, and visca versa.).  This is more noticeable in the more brightly-lit scenes.Also, the three films are fairly weak and short in duration (about 30 minutes).  The most interesting one is Adventures in 3D, with Elvira (although her presence seems pointless).  This ""documentary"" covers early 3D movies, the various 3D processes and incarnations over the years.  As an adult, I found this very interesting, although the introductions between each segment are overlong and annoying (some guy behind a futuristic control panel arguing with a snarky floating robot).  However, the 3D effects really shine in ""Alien Encounter"", where space creatures end up invading a closed amuzement park and take several roller-coaster type trips.The system is hooked up to your DVD in this manner:  There is a ""decoder"" box that has in/out RCA jacks on it.  This box is connected between the DVD player and the TV.  The glasses plug into this box.  I guess the decoder box helps synchronize the left/right lenses of the glasses with the left/right alternating images on the TV screen.One nice thing about the system is that there are more movies out there that will work with this system.  Also, there is a 3D camcorder lens available from this company that works with this system so you can make 3D home movies!  How awesome is THAT? (And it really works--I bought one and have been really geeked about it!).In any event, a very interesting gadget, one I was so impressed with that I bought a second set as a graduation present for my nephew recently and he was pretty impressed as well.  4 stars for the package, as there are still some technical issues to be resolved for 3D home viewing (i.e., the flickering mentioned above).Pick up ""Spy Kids 3D:  The Extreme 3D Edition (HQFS)"" and/or ""Transitions 3D"", recently released and they work with this system.  Very kewl.  I have also recently picked up the HQFS version of Santa vs. the Snowman here at Amazon.  Check my 3D movie list I generated for all of the titles I am aware of for purchase here at Amazon (the list is longer than you might think!).***There ARE other FS (field sequential) movies out there, as well, but they take a little research to find.  I have come across Andy Worhol's Flesh for Frankenstein, Jaws 3D, Friday the 13th Part III in 3D, Creature from the Black Lagoon, House of Wax, It Came from Outer Space, Dial M For Murder, and others.

After the murder of his wife and daughter, Jericho sees no reason to go on, but ends up becoming involved in a new case that could mean the end of the world for everyone.  At the cusp of the millenium, Satan comes to Earth, taking a human body and walking the streets of New York City, searching for his bride, Christine York (Robin Tunney), in which, if her flesh is consumated by the prince darkness, it will literally be Hell on Earth as mankind knows it.  Now, CANE, must protect her anyway that he can to be sure that SATAN doesn't bring about the END OF DAYS.MY REVIEW:This movie is hard to categorize as whether it's an action movie, a horror film, a spiritual/religious film or just a thriller type drama with great special effects.Director PETER HYAMS (The Relic, The Musketeer) directs this ensamble group of actors which include: ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, ROBIN TUNNEY, KEVIN POLLACK, GABRIEL BYRNE and ROD STEIGER.ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER deserves a lot of credit for his role, which can very well be related to MEL GIBSON's character in LETHAL WEAPON.  What strikes me as odd is his ability to really show character and acting ability.  I've never seen him do anything like this before.  He really is a simple, caring, emotional human being who isn't just out there to shoot everything up and save the day.  He cares for this girl and cares for the world, which is something ARNOLD has never done before.  His age is starting to show, but he still pulls this one off, and still knows hard-core action.GABRIEL BYRNE deserves an Academy Award, pulling his Satan character off perfectly.  There is nothing scary about his performance, it's just the fact that you can actually see the evil in his character.  His lines are great, and his performance is spectacular.  For those of you who might be thinking like ANTHONY HOPKINS as HANNIBAL LECTER- you've got it.  It's that kind of chilling performance, that isn't scary, just fun and thrilling.ROBIN TUNNEY is probably the worst actress in this movie.  Her character is very unbelievable.  She can't work well with dialouge.  This role was just obviously to serious for her to pull off with a charm.  You literally have no feeling for this woman because she has no character built around her.  TUNNEY works better as her role in VERTICAL LIMIT.  This role might-as-well been given to MOLLY SHANNON!!!  ROBIN TUNNEY just couldn't pull it off.KEVIN POLLACK plays BOBBY CHICAGO, the hilarious sidekick pal, opposite SCHWARZENEGGER.  His lines are great, and will make you laugh a lot of the time.  His character is realistic and often fun.  He's of course the comedic humor of the film, which every film has to have at some point.ROD STEIGER just looks like a priest to me, and that's what he is, and plays a good one.  There couldn't have been a better choice.  Just take one look at him and you'll know.Potentially the story for the film is interesting, but considering that writer ANDREW MARLOWE (Hollow Man, Air Force One) was trying to follow the book of REVELATION, I take away half a star.  The story is inaccurate, although fun and action packed.  This is one of the best scripts he's ever written.I was in awe by the directing of PETER HYAMS who's past credits include 2010 and THE RELIC.  He really worked well with the majority of actors and pulled the story together.  He deserves some credit as well.The special effects were above average, from the explosions to train wrecks and so on.  STAN WINSTON's SATAN creature was top notch and could scare the heck out of even ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER!  If the majority of people don't give this movie credit for its story and acting, they have to at least give credit to the special effects.I look at this film as a serious one, specifically because I'm a Christian myself and I find this story a very compelling one.  Although the film is very inaccurate, it is still an entertaining film which is more serious than most people think.  It's funny to see people put this film down when it's something they couldn't do in a lifetime.Why don't people like this movie?  It's simple.  People look at movies in different directions than others.  Most people think of this one as a cheap piece of nonsense that tries to use a biblical story as a backdrop for a special effects actioner starring ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER.  I look at it as all around good-time fun.  The really STRANGE sex scene and language wasn't needed, which could've possibly lowered the rating to a PG-13.  And if you pump up ROBIN TUNNEY's character to a solid, than you got a five star movie.  But the way it lies, in my eyes, it deserves four stars.  No one can deny this movie is entertaining, but no one can deny that this film also has its failures....",4.0,0.25,1,3,0.5106,positive,0.9983,very positive,2001,8,9

739336,B00008DDVU,A1PNNR3B9H8GTC,6,9,2004-08-29,Provacative and Uncompromising,"Produced, written and directed by the inimitable Michael Moore, Bowling For Columbine examines how domestic fears have increased America's obsession with guns and scrutinizes the tragedies that have befallen countless individuals in this country as the result of that obsession. Moore's bravado and showmanship always brings high entertainment value to all of his documentaries, and it is always a pleasure to see him exposing the spinelessness or hypocrisy of some political pawn or coporate underling. It is unfortunate to reflect that despite the noble intentions of the filmmaker, Bowling for Columbine rarely offers definitive answers to the social issues it discusses and often recklessly and foolishly correlates American violence with everything from our nation's foreign policy to killer bees. Nevertheless, the film is undeniably provocative, and never fails to directly confront the forces it opposes. Among the highlights of the movie: a hard hitting interview with NRA president Charlton Heston (in which the Oscar winning actor appears too befuddled and insensitive to effectively discuss the ideals of his organization), an interview with the producer of the television show COPS (who shows no compunction for fostering fear and loathing of minorities because ""violence sells,"") and an encounter with Oklahoma City bombing suspect James Nichols (who encourages people to own guns, but believes that the personal ownership of nuclear weapons should be illegal because ""there are some real sickos out there""). It would all be funny if it wasn't so profoundly terrifying and thought provoking.",4.0,0.6666666666666666,1,2,0.0,neutral,-0.9321,very negative,2004,8,29
664021,B00005LOUP,A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE,0,0,2010-12-11,A Wonderful Christmas Classic,"Background:This story was written in rhymed verse by Dr Seuss and was first published in 1957. It included artwork from the author as well. The concept of the work was to poke fun at those who commercialize Christmas and satirized those who profit from taking a ruthless advantage of the holiday.The Grinch, lives in a cave high atop Mount Crumpit, a steep 3,000-foot high mountain just north of Whoville, where everyone else lives in this story. The setting is believed to be based on the Town of Easthampton, Massachusetts, and the overlooking mountain named Mount Tom. This location is close to where Dr Seuss grew up.This story was first produced as an animated special in 1966, subsequently, in the year 2000 (November), it was adapted into a live action movie (note that it is not a 100% adaptation, since there are some changes). This is the production that we are now reviewing.Opinion:This adaption is well done and Jim Carrey does an excellent job as the Grinch. This movie is a lot of fun and the television stations are normally always sure to include it in their Christmas viewing specials. Yet because it is such a classic in itself as a movie production, many people still choose to make the purchase to keep it as a collector's piece. (And will enjoy the special features on the DVD.)Since everyone may be familiar with the story already, I will just comment on the production aspects of this film.The make up firstly is superb, all of the adult characters have nose pieces on that give them that cartoon like look. It is masterfully done, and there is no loss in the facial expressions.Next, the sets, especially Whoville is a wonderful piece of artistic design, it just totally adds to the whole 'atmosphere' of Christmas and wonder that comes with this season. The props also are all well designed this includes all the vehicles and equipment (including a Christmas Light Canon - used for putting lights on the house very quickly) keeps the Christmas 'magic' level high in the film.Conclusion:This is now a Christmas staple in terms of being a classic that helps to bring in the Christmas season every year. It is a wonderful movie that the whole family can sit down and enjoy together. But most of all, it teaches us the real value of Christmas. It is not just the gifts, the trees and the food; but it is just being together and the goodwill that is expressed at this time of year.",4.0,0.0,1,2,0.5719,positive,0.9781,very positive,2010,12,11

Picard beams down to an abandoned mining asteroid and finds Keel accompanied by the captains of two other vessels. Before the meeting begins, Keel asks Picard several trick questions designed to verify that he is indeed Picard. After Keel is convinced that it is Picard, he then describes what he believes is a conspiracy at the highest levels of Star Fleet. Picard is skeptical, so he has Data search the records looking for anomalies in the patterns of orders.  As only he can, Data finds anomalies that indicate something unusual is going on. While not conclusive, it strongly suggests there may be a conspiracy. This is reinforced when they discover that Keel's ship has been destroyed. After thinking about it, Captain Picard makes the decision to travel to Earth to make a call at Star Fleet Command.Upon arriving at Earth, contact is made with the commanders of Star Fleet and all appears normal. Picard and Riker are invited to beam down and dine with the commanders and Admiral Quinn beams up to the Enterprise. Picard quickly realizes that the man he is talking to is not the Admiral and instructs Riker to stay on the Enterprise and investigate Quinn. Suddenly, the aged Admiral starts fighting with Riker, easily defeating him and Geordi. Even Worf is no match for the incredible strength exhibited by Quinn. He is stopped only when Doctor Crusher stuns him with a phaser.Once the Admiral is in sick bay, Doctor Crusher discovers that a small parasite is attached to his brain and controlling him. Riker beams down to the planet with a false parasite installed and is able to rescue Captain Picard and together, they defeat the remainder of the infected Admirals. They discover a mother parasite, which they kill. The death of the mother causes all of the other parasites to die and their hosts then fully recover.While this episode is a good one and demonstrates what could be the most effective way to defeat the Federation. The tactics of the creatures is very similar to those used by Khan in ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan."" However, there is one very weak point to the plot. To date, the creatures have been very effective in infiltrating Star Fleet, so the Admiral's open confrontation with the crew of the Enterprise is a very poor tactical move. This episode is most well known for the exploding head of the human containing the body of the mother of the parasites. In my opinion, it is appropriate, in that the creature inside had to be made visible. Since the creatures infect the brain, it is the logical way to expose them. I consider the episode to be average in terms of quality, not great, but certainly not one of the weaker ones. However, it would have been better if there had been more discussion about learning more about the life form rather than simply killing it off.",4.0,0.0,4,1,0.0,neutral,-0.9718,very negative,2004,10,28

The fantasy is explained rather coherently - mutants have developed and must be undercover for their own safety until leaders emerge, young lads from the year 1944 struggling with their peculiar identity until something pushes them to the point of taking advantage of their supernatural powers and they become committed to gathering all the other mutants together as a positive force by the time they reach adulthood. Or as the PR piece states it 'Before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time. Before they were archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together, with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known. In the process, a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between Magneto's Brotherhood and Professor X's X-MEN.'James McAvoy is Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender is Erik Lensherr and the mutants the gather around them include Jennifer Lawrence, Lucas Till, Nicholas Hoult, Caleb Landry Jones, Edi Gathegi, &Aacute;lex Gonz&aacute;lez, and even a quick peek at Hugh Jackman.  The year switches to 1962 when Russia and the USA were coming close to nuclear war so of course the mutants fight for the end of the attempt while another set of bad mutants under the leadership of Kevin Bacon and January Jones and Jason Flemyng et al face off battling powers of telecommunication and various forms of super human acts an by the end of the film the 'together boys' - Charles and Erik have become Professor X and Magneto.  Doting the over two hour long landscape are appearances by Rose Byrne playing the love interest and Oliver Platt simply called the Man in Black.  it is a game of subterfuge as well as a gradually coming to terms with being a mutant that keeps the ball rolling to a rather spectacularly staged battle scene as the Russian missiles are making their way toward Cuba and the United States.Matthew Vaughn directs the screenplay written by no fewer than 6 writers ad there are some impressive special effects demonstrated as the characteristics of each of the mutants.  Entertaining, yes, and it stands alone well enough so that those of us who have not seen the other installments in the series  can enjoy it as a 'beginning'.

Made four years after TV classics like ""Charlie Brown Christmas"" and ""Great Pumpkin"", this film doesn't have the yearly replay value of those, but is classic nonetheless. In it, Charlie Brown establishes himself as the worlds first ""emo"" kid with a barrage of disappointment situations that we're all familiar of. Then he decides to try to beat his own curse by competing in the school's spelling bee and reluctantly makes it to state championship. Can this cursed little bald kid finally win at something?Paramount did an odd job with this disc. While it's surprisingly in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen, some of the graphics seem to be cut off on all four sides like it was originally in 1.33:1. And even though the colors/black levels are spot-on & sharp, there is varying degrees of print damage throughout the entire picture, though some may be due to the cel-animation of forty years ago than the master itself. The 5.1/2.0 mixes are new and effective, but at times it's dated jazzy '60's soundtrack doesn't get any more modern sounding because of it. Also too bad that there's not one extra or trailer for it or any other Peanuts video product on it (lost opportunity). But with it's Woodstock-like split screen effects and entertaining storyline, it was well worth the purchase and my little one was entertained, even if she kept asking me when they were finally going Trick-Or-Treating already....Personally growing up on the animation side of Peanuts, I still found it's sequel ""Snoopy, Come Home"" to be a better overall movie, but this one still has plenty to see and enjoy. In fact strangely this release of the film (why did it take until 2006 for this to debut on DVD?) is actually uncut! Meaning Paramount put back in it six whole minutes that were deleted after test audiences in 1969 thought it ran too long. In a way I can see their point, but it's a time-capsule of an era of animation gone way by, like that bald kid's chances of ever kicking that football.

The guy (Mark Rylance) decides to follow the woman (Kerry Fox), discovers she's married and works in a shabby theater, and is married to a not-overly-bright man who has too many chins and a puffy lower lip like Alfred Hitchcock's. Both of the men want her and she decides to stay with her husband and children. End of plot.This is about as deglamorized a movie as has recently appeared. At first, both Rylance and Fox look like the kind of people who are right up there in the first rank of the third rate. He runs a bar. He's balding, skinny, always needs a shave, and lives alone in some seedy dump that looks like a Soviet-era zheloy dom. She first appears with her hair up, working-class style, glumly groomed. And the two of them are photographed -- dressed or otherwise -- in a way that makes their skin seem to emit a pale sickly blue. Your first thought is liable to be a red flag: This is going to be one depressing flick.Then as the plot develops -- hard as it is to follow in its details -- we come to know them surprisingly well, the two of them. Rylance takes on a certain pathetic charm with his scarred eyebrow and occasional stutter. And Kerry Fox lets her hair down, literally, and we can see the self-knowledge and the desire in her big blue New Zealand eyes. They become likable.In many ways the most admirable person important to the story is Timothy Spall as Kerry's husband, the Hitchcockian cab driver. He's not particularly bright and he trusts people a bit too much. And, man, he looks unprepossessing. But he's gregarious, generous, good-natured, and as harmless as a child. When he discovers that Rylance and Fox have been boffing each other, what does he do? Does he pick up a gun and spray lead. Does he do a plastic-surgery number on Rylance's face? Nope. He goes round to Rylance's bar, has a beer, and tells Rylance that he loves his wife. And that every day he loves her more. Later, when Fox prompts him to ventilate his anger over her affair, all he can come up with is something like, ""I don't care about that s***! What really bothers me is that you're a lousy actress and will never be anything else!"" When he's done shouting, she replies, ""You don't even know how to hurt me."" There are other characters in the story too -- children, an ex-wife, somebody named Victor with a Scots accent, and a gay French bartender who philosophizes a lot. (I wonder if the writers had a particular model in mind.) Next to Kerry's husband, the French guy is about the most articulate of the bunch.But that's the problem with the movie. I was frankly lost at times. I honestly don't know how Spall's character found out about his wife's affair. Evidently she confirmed suspicions he already had, but since the scene doesn't appear on screen we have to guess. In fact, if the love scenes are speechless, the rest of the script isn't much better. More than once a character says to another, ""I can't understand a word you're saying."" Sometimes I couldn't either. ""We shouldn't be gay because someone died."" ""Nobody died."" ""I died once. It was the only day I could tell the whole truth."" I think we're in ""Last Year at Marienbad"" territory here. A shouting match between Rylance and Kerry in the basement theater made no sense to me at all. It reminded me of my marriage.I recommend it though. It's a rare movie made for adults. It's a challenging drama about lives that are either half empty or half full, depending on how you look at them. The ending is sad, but we are at least left with the hope that these characters can mend their tattered lives and get on with things.",4.0,1.0,1,1,0.6369,very positive,-0.6826,very negative,2007,3,9
510013,B00000K3CB,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,1,1,2003-09-22,Good Interpretation of the Ray Bradbury Novel,"Ray Bradbury is a Midwesterner.  Many of his novels and short stories capture the flavor of the Midwest so well that it may be difficult for those who have grown up elsewhere to understand the feel of his stories, if not the meaning of the stories themselves.  Such is the case for ""Something Wicked this Way Comes.""Our story is set in a turn-of-the-century small town in Illinois.  The time of year is autumn, a season often poetically exploited by Bradbury.  Cooger and Dark's Pandemonium Carnival breezes into small-town Illinois one dark and dreary October day, and suddenly the waning day became even more dark than usual.  Thirteen year old Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade, best friends through thick and thin, are witness to the eerie arrival of a carnival set up but moments after the carnival train arrives.The over-quick setup of the carnival is but one sign of the weirdness to come, as one person after another succumbs to the temptations presented by the carnival.  In one case, a woman longs for lost beauty.  In another, a man longs for lost love.  Another man longs for a lost leg.  The list is long, and while useful to establish the nature of the carnival, risks diluting the principal theme of the story.At first only Will and Jim recognize the evil intent behind the carnival.  It is not long before Mr. Dark discovers that Will and Jim have recognized the true nature of the carnival, and then actively seeks to capture the boys and neutralize them.  Will and Jim are suddenly on the run for their lives.  Fortunately Jim's dad Charles Halloway, played by Jason Robards, is convinced of the nature of the carnival by the boys and helps the boys survive and overcome the evil of the carnival.The story was originally released in 1962, significantly predating the much more serious and bloody Stephen King novel ""Needful Things,"" which pursued a similar approach in that the townspeople were tempted by their wants and succumbed, though in the latter novel accepting temptation generated further evil.  In ""Something Wicked"" accepting temptation leads to loss, but generally only personal loss.The story is focused on the two boys, which makes the story better for teenagers, though I am very fond of the book and the movie even now.  Also, the story is set in rural Illinois, and autumn in the Midwest and Northeast have a feel very that can be a bit eerie, but difficult to understand unless you grew up in places where the leaves turn color and die in the fall as Halloween approaches, and there is a feeling of mystery in the air.  You might observe that this movie was not filmed in Illinois, which should have been obvious given that Illinois is generally flat throughout most of the state.The movie was created in 1983 at a time when special effects technology was advancing quite rapidly.  The special effects in the movie are now dated somewhat, which detracts further from the movie.In spite of the flaws in the movie, the feel of the book is still there.  When the movie starts with the view of the locomotive coming down the tracks, dark and vaguely foreboding, the tone of the movie is established.  Blowing leaves, dark colors and minor musical keys are used to enhance the feeling of the movie, which is more a dark fantasy than a horror story.  The movie allows a boy's viewpoint to explore the nature of life and temptation, which allows for more gasps and awe than we would feel as adults.  I recommend this movie for those who have enjoyed Bradbury in print, and are looking for a dark fantasy that approaches, but just misses the mark of real horror.",4.0,1.0,3,2,0.6369,very positive,-0.4633,negative,2003,9,22

It didn't bother me, I liked it-- it only added to the overall tone of the film, which is one of chaos, confusion, and lots of running.Great perfomances by Matt Damon, Joan Allen, and Julia Stiles (who truly looked absolutely terrified when Bourne put a gun to her head).

Most romantic comedies could be written by brain-dead zombies and have more originality. After watching hours of that drivel (my wife likes them),She's Out of My Leaguewas refreshing. For the first time in far too long, I laughed out loud at a romantic comedy. The movie was genuinely funny, meaningful, and not always predictable.Despite the scenario ((hot girl, deadbeat guy),She's Out of My Leaguedoesn't peddle the usual bromides about ""love being blind"" or ""good things happen to good people."" Rather, it's about self-esteem. This makes the characters and plot more interesting and subtle. I'm not going to claim that there's Oscar-winning character development inShe's Out of My League, but Molly, the hot girl, and Larry, the not so hot guy, do seem like realistic personalities. Larry does not ""refashion"" himself into a stud (although there is one incident with shaving a certain area...). Molly isn't the ""perfect"" hot girl, but has insecurities of her own and a need to play it safe. They're helped by a decent script with dialogue that doesn't seem too forced or awkward (except for the cursing - see below). It is kind of possible to see why they fall in love with each other - it makes sense in a way that most romantic comedies don't.My only problem with the movie is the overload of cursing and sex references. I understand that's standard fare in most comedies nowadays. Frankly, I found most of it funny. Sometimes, however, it just became too much (how many times do you really need to drop the f-bomb? You don't actually need it to express anger in every scene). It got to a point where it seemed like the scriptwriters couldn't think of anything better to fill the space. Fortunately, this doesn't take away from the movie too much, but it might not be a good idea to watch this with anybody who's sensitive about those sorts of things.She's Out of My Leaguehad real potential, and I'd like to see more work from this set of directors, scriptwriters, and actors (well, maybe better scriptwriters).

The plot of Bringing Out the Dead is not really of any concern, Scorsese is purely concerned with atmosphere and character development.In many ways this  film is a retread of previous (and better) Scorsese films. The scummy noir  that was utilized so wonderully in &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; and &quot;Mean  Streets&quot; is re-created here again, right down to the steaming sewer  grates. In many ways Cage is a more updated version of Travis Bickle. He  works long nights, deals with much of society's trash, becomes delusional  and eventually begins to think that he is in someway &quot;better&quot;  than his surroundings. He feels that he is the only person who can help  these sad sick people.Bringing Out the Dead is a very exhaustive film to  watch. There are constant flashbacks to a young girl that Cage was unable  to save. these are mostly unecessary and never really lead anywhere. Also  the relationship between Cage and Arquette continues to surface throughout  the film but at the same time seems rather laboured and pointless.The  best moments are during the films adrenalized sequences. The thought of  what may happen next in the film is often more appealing than what does  actually occur. Tom Sizemore and Ving Rhames also turn in first class,  oscar worthy perfomances, the former as a crazed paramedic and the latter  as the only person who seems completely in control of their mind for the  entire film.Bringing Out the Dead is a very well made film that is quite  rewarding if you can get through it. Unfortunately it is merely an exercise  in noir atmospherics that eventually will wear down even the most ardent of  Scorsese fans. It just doen't seem like the man is challenging himself much  with this material.Better than his last effort, Kundun (which was still  quite good) but by no means his best film to date.I can't wait for  &quot;Gangs of New York.&quot;",4.0,0.0,1,2,0.0,neutral,0.8753,very positive,2000,3,19

Jennifer Garner plays a 13 year old unpopular girl who desperately wishes to be a sophisticated adult woman.  She gets her wish, only to find out that her life is essentially meaningless.  She is popular and successful but is not a very nice person, and many of her so called friendships are rather superficial.  She falls in love with her childhood friend Matt, who she was cruel to, only to find out he is engaged to somebody else.  Garner's character then wishes to return to childhood to embrace this friend, even though he was ""nerdy"" and unpopular.13 Going on 30 is very predictable.  However, that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Garner is very charming in this movie, and the film is every bit as fun and entertaining as I hoped it would be.  However, it also has a lot of meaning.  It really makes a person appreciate the people who are important in your life.  I don't have any children, but I would definitely recommend this film for parents to watch with their children.  It could have a significantly positive impact on their social interactions in junior high and high school.  Hopefully, it will make them realize that being popular and hanging out with popular kids is rather meaningless in the long term.

Earthquakes. Then some small elements that could lead to something else and a few geologists to prove it with theories that prove nothing but create anxiety. The geologists are women and that adds a touch of male-chauvinism when all the men (and they are only men, firemen, policemen, all kind of city workers and underground operators and security people, men, men and men again, and if you can find women they are geologists, doctors, nurses, news journalists, but not security personnel, though there might be one or two on the fringes but not in the middle of the action) of the security services don't believe her. Add to that a few simple but strongly emotional personal situations like a ""single"" father and his 13 year old daughter caught in the mess, and a couple more elements like that, even a couple of dogs, and you have what you need to create an emotional and fascinating catastrophe film. The rest is just special effects and there no one is better than catastrophe film makers to get these special effects right. So the catastrophe that has one chance in a million years to happen can be imagined in Los Angeles, but not too hard though like the volcanic eruptions  that created Japan or those that submerged northern India with an immense basaltic plateau a couple of miles thick. Just a small little thing but right in the middle of LA with the underground as one of the main in-going avenues, along with Wilshire boulevard or whatever, for the lava to seize the city from underground.

He's such a sport about the scholarship kid coming in and taking his place on the football team. My favorite part is when he tells Green, ""If you get into Harvard, you'll deserve it,"" (subtext: unlike me). He was even prepared to take it like a man when Green steals his girl.

The answer to the question is like the movie; complicated.  This is definitely NOT the type of movie that I typically like.  I feel that everyday life is hard enough; I want movies to entertain me and make me feel better.  This isn't a feel-better movie.  Miral's life has been sad in many ways and she lives in a part of the world that hasn't known peace in centuries.  She sees things that need changing and, like young people all over the world, she thinks that no one else has ever tried to change them, or they've used the wrong things.  She thinks she knows the right way.  And she gets in over her head.  Still, she's likeable and you keep thinking that she will come out right in the end, even if she can't change her world.  The movie is difficult in other ways, too.  If you speak English, be sure and turn on the subtitles or you won't have a clue as to what is happening.  And even with the subtitles, you'll be confused a lot.  It's hard to figure out a lot of things because they are just not things you encounter in the Western World.  I had no idea what a girl her age is allowed to do or not do, so I was never sure when she was going somewhere or doing something that she shouldn't.  But it also gives a little picture of what life in that world is like and the movie is, over all, well made.  You need to know that it is not a family movie.  There's a rape scene (not too graphic, but you know what has happened) and a belly-dancing scene and both aren't really suitable for kids.  It's a depressing movie in some ways, too, as Miral tries to deal with her world and her life.  I doubt that this movie is destined to be one that the average person would watch again and again, but it's worth watching at least once (and you may need to watch it twice just to understand it) if you are interested in that part of the world and what is happening.

In Season 5,  the color has a real Technicolor feel about it as opposed to the cheaper (but memorable) process of Hollywood in the mid-1940's where the producer, Ross Hunter, gussied up his romantic stories  with a technique known as Pathe. Furthermore, there is sense that the producers and directors have really aimed toward high technical virtuosity and have, in fact, succeeded to the detriment of plot and story line. In previous Seasons,  humor was mixed with melancholy and a pointed existential flair, but in  Season 5 I sensed  a zany three-stooges farcical thread. Additionally, there's quite a bit of profanity in  5; nothing to worry about  for kids of any age, but a noticeable shift, I felt.

The handlers were forced to put the animal down (previously filmed footage and other chimps would be used for the remainder of the films), Henry required 20 stitches, then infection set in and he developed a high fever and monkey fever delirium for several days, with filming halted for three weeks, while he recuperated. As he recovered, he announced he was finished playing 'Tarzan', after he fulfilled the three-film commitment (producer Sy Weintraub had planned to introduce a 'Tarzan' TV series, starring Henry, while the features were still in theatres; Ron Ely would be brought in, to play Tarzan in the television series...). Henry then sued Weintraub's production company for negligence, winning the case and an unpublished cash settlement.Needless to say, it wasn't the happiest of times on the Tarzan set!Despite all the drama, ""Great River"" isn't a bad film, if not in the league of the earlier Weintraub Tarzan entries. The story is set along the Amazon, and was filmed in Brazil (although stock footage of African lions and hippos would be added, as rather incongruous 'padding'). A leopard 'cult' headed by Olympian Rafer Johnson (as a voodoo-like leader), is attacking villages and using the populations as slave labor to extract diamonds from the hills, and Tarzan is called in to bring the cult down. Utilizing the lion and chimp from ""Valley of Gold"" (but with different names, reintroducing 'Cheeta' to the series), Tarzan befriends steamer captain Sam Bishop (actor/comedian Jan Murray), and his young first mate (Manuel Padilla Jr., in his second Tarzan feature; he would go on to become a regular in the television series). Rescuing a pretty doctor (Diana Millay) from a raid, our heroes move upriver to the expected, rather unsurprising climax. Still, Mike Henry looks powerful and dangerous, the closest embodiment to the classic Russ Manning Tarzan illustrations, ever. It's a shame Henry never had better scripts, or a safer working environment, as he might have become the best Tarzan of all!He makes this film worthwhile!",4.0,1.0,3,1,0.0,neutral,0.9798,very positive,2010,5,13

That, along with the movie's entertaining musical soundtrack, makes this film a must-see for all.In regards to the acting, ""Any Given Sunday"" shows a variety of talent, experience, along with stars-in-the-making. Jamie Foxx is an example of the latter. His performance as brash, young, third-string-quarterback ""Willie Beaman"", brought into the limelight after injuries sustained by veteran Dennis Quaid, is the perfect showcase for the actor's emerging skills. It is no wonder that Foxx won an Oscar this year and he deserved a nomination for AGS.Cameron Diaz, as the general manager of the fictional Miami Sharks, is quite good as a woman in charge of a male-dominated position. She holds her own with the more seasoned performers that populate this dynamic film.Quaid gives another underrated performance as the washed-up quarterback with one more good game to play. James Woods, one of the best character actors today, delivers another flawless job as the seedy team doctor. Matthew Modine, L.L. Cool J, and Aaron Eckhart match him in other supporting roles.Though her role is small, Lauren Holly gets some points for her performance as Quaid's supportive and determined wife.Actor/songwriter Clifton Davis (one of the stars of the 80's sitcom ""Amen"" and composer of The Jackson Five's ""Never Can Say Goodbye"") has a moment in the sun as the mayor of Miami.Football legends Jim Brown and Lawrence Taylor are effective in their roles of assistant coach and veteran linesman, respectively.Smaller roles are assayed by legends Ann-Margret (cast as Diaz's mother and widow of the team's former owner) and Charlton Heston as the football commissioner. As a tribute to the actor, as well as providing a fitting comparison between football's modern-day gladiators to those of ancient times, a montage of scenes from ""Ben-Hur"" are intertwined between events unfolding in the film's story.But the movie belongs to Al Pacino, an actor of unparalleled talent that immerses himself in the role of the ""old school"" coach that must make deal with a changing sports world and the traditions that he holds so dearly. When his ""Tony D'Amato"" cries, so does the audience. When he is frustrated at the team's loss, the audience feels that frustration. When he experiences joy, that feeling is shared by all.If Stone hadn't had such a mixed track record of hits and misses, an Oscar might be on Pacino's shelf, for he surely deserved one for this film.",4.0,0.6,2,4,0.0,neutral,0.9946,very positive,2005,9,11

This ability is shown to perfection is this extremely funny 1934 film. Though made one year after the restrictive Hayes Office banned all inneuendo in films, this movie manages to revolve around the subject of ""having fun"" with your dating partner before marriage. Harlow is paired with the underrated Franchot Tone, who was at his apex of fame here, and then sadly was reduced to playing in supporting roles, then ultimately bit parts in B movies. But Tone effortlessly captures the mood of the piece and excels in the role of besotted playboy. The magnificent Lionel Barrymore plays the crabby father of Tone and who is also Harlow's initial love interest. Yes, you read it right, Lionel Barrymore plays (for a little while) a ladies man. That is a first for him.There are enough witty moments to keep you interested and Harlow always glows with a unique screen charisma. Though predictable in its twists and turns, it still rivets the viewer, all these years later. The only flaw is that movie is a scant 72 minutes in length, one wishes it could have continued for another half hour. This is a great old movie which has held up marvelously. If you've never had the pleasure of watching Harlow, this would be an excellent first choice to sample her magic.",4.0,1.0,1,1,0.5859,positive,0.9953,very positive,2003,7,24

I liked the music and excitement  very much  and have tried to order it several times since those days.  It became available on Amazon recently and I purchased a copy immediately.The story concerns the tour of an American classical music orchestra in Belgium during the last part of World War II. The scenery is largely a castle and the forest surrounding it;  and the music is really fine with the works of Beethoven, Brahms, Wagner and Schubert interlaced during the story.  The main theme of this film is the competition between two strong personalities.  Lionel Evans (Charlton Heston) the American orchestra conductor, fears for the safety of his musicians;  and General Schiller (Maximilian Schell) is German commanding officer of troops pushing forward in the Battle of the Bulge.  Evans refuses to regard his orchestra as prisoners of war because they are all civilians.  Schiller only sees the inconvenience of having his forces be responsible for a musical group while he is bogged down in the battle.  He also wishes the orchestra to perform some of his favorite music.  Evans flatly refuses.  The question of what will happen to the orchestra once  German forces continue the offensive hangs over the whole story!All types of individuals are intermingled  in this film and the constant sound of bombing in the distance supplies additional suspense.  I do not believe this movie ever received much acclaim or interest and it should have.

This is one of the rare movies in which you actually believe in what the main characters are fighting for and how the death of one human being can effect so many people and cause so much grief...After the death of Evelyn Mercer in a store robbery, her four adopted sons: Bobby [Mark Wahlberg], Angel [Tyrese Gibson], Jeremiah [Andre Benjamin], and Jack ""CrackerJack"" [Garret Hedlund], return to the town that the grew up in for her funeral.The thing that links the audience to the characters is that all four of them aren't even related, but were all adopted by the kind woman who knew that they didn't even have a secure future in their lives. Angel and Jeremiah are black, and Bobby and Jack are white. However the four brothers still love each other and consider themselves family, no matter how many people look at them strangely as they call themselves brothers.The plot of the movie takes a dark turn as the four brothers start to learn that the random murder of Evelyn may not have been random at all. What results from that startling revelation is that Bobby, Angel, and Jack disobey police orders to not get involved in the case and go on a driven quest to find out who killed their beloved mother and why.The movie is filled with violence, and strong language. Some scenes involve drive by shootings, a wild car chase between the brothers and the two men who killed their mom, and a fist fight at the end between one of the brothers [I won't spoil who it is] and the sole man responsible for the death.Crooked cops, corrupt politicains, gang members, and organized crime all take shots at the four men and some scenes seem to have a million bullets flying everywhere. But there are moments of intense excitement and none of the action scenes seem to be overdone on violent killings. This is one movie that actually puts in the right amount of violence, mixed with the perfect amount of character buildup and even some bonding between the brothers that even they didn't know they could have.Extras of the Disks:Commentary by director John SingletonBehind the Brotherhood [A look at the different characters]Some deleted scenesEnglish and Spanish subtitlesand a showing of the making of the movieplus more....Highly recommended, this is one movie you need to see at least once......",4.0,1.0,2,2,-0.2023,negative,-0.9873,very negative,2005,12,27

1142996,B0013J55B6,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,1,1,2008-09-01,"(3.5 STARS) Everybody Hates Hancock, Superhero: Good Concept Not Fully Developed","Everybody hates John Hancock because he has superpowers. The concept of Will Smith as a superhero every citizen of the city dislikes is brilliant, but its execution is not always so. ""Hancock"" is definitely entertaining because it is Will Smith after all, but there is something missing in the slick direction of Peter Berg (""The Kingdom"").""Hancock"" is an action comedy, or comedy action. It is not a mystery novel, but considerable part of its eventful story should remain untold. All I can say is in the film's first half the director effectively infuses enough humor into his storytelling to keep the film's serious tone in check. The opening sequence shows our hero Hancock flying unsteadily over the city of Los Angels, chasing three criminals in a car. The three guys soon find that the man is not only a superhero; he is drunk. You don't mess with a drunken superhero because the results are predictably catastrophic.A failed PR man Ray (Jason Bateman) offers Hancock a chance to be a ""real"" superhero. I should not reveal Ray's plan here; his idea may not be brilliant, but certainly something that Ray, a family man, but not a shrewd businessman, would think of. Sadly Bateman's character is rather one-dimensional. His wife Mary played by Charlize Theron fares much better, being more layered. In what way she is ""layered,"" you have to see the film for yourself. But perhaps you already know it. Even so, there are some funny scenes in the kitchen waiting for you.You may not like the change of tone the film goes through in wrapping up the story, ""Hancock"" stops self-mocking and genre-subverting and it starts to take itself seriously. The film so far has shown only sketchy rules about the superhero's ability, but the film's final chapter suddenly introduces another set of rules to the film's world. The transition from one tone to another looks a bit abrupt and the narrative is rushed at times.For all these flaws, ""Hancock"" is fun thanks to the slick direction of Peter Berg and effective performance of Will Smith as Hancock. As I said before, it is an enjoyable ride. Hancock is not trying to be a Batman even though sometimes I think the recent Batman films are actually doing the same thing in a different way.",4.0,1.0,22,2,0.0,neutral,0.9919,very positive,2008,9,1

Having been a big ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" fan, I was surprised. Talking dolphins and wise-guy teens seemed too reminiscent of ""Lost in Space"" and ""Star Trek:TNG"" with Will Robinson and Wesley Crusher. However, I caught the re-runs on the Sci-fi Channel, and actually got into it. Some. But the show was neither fish nor fowl- it had science fiction and espionage elements, but it also had ghost stories, too. Obviously Roy Scheider got tired of this, and got out in the third season to be replaced by Michael Ironside.The whole show did a 180 when Ironside came on board. The easy going atmosphere under Scheider was replaced with a hard nosed military attitude. Some of the best stories were in the third season, including one where the SeaQuest gets involved in the Cuban Missle Crisis.The biggest problem was the show started to center around boy genius Brandeis. It became stories of a boy and his dolphin, or a boy, his dolphin, and his developing hormones as he oogled older female crew members.  I wouldn't be surprised if that's one reason Scheider chucked his role overboard.The SeaQuest itself was an oddly designed boat (submarines are considered boats, not ships). It never really grabbed me, either. I built a model of it, and still think it has no real ""grace"" to it, unlike VTTBOTS's Seaview.Incongruous as it may seem, I still give it 4 stars, because I think the producers had their heart in the right place.

However even though ""The Puppet Masters"" is arguably one of the best sci-fi *stories* ever written, the movie (as usual), does it no justice at all.  All the essential social elements have been removed and as is so often the case in science fiction movies the scene has been moved to the present day presumeably to make the audience identify with the characters more and also to save money on special effects.All the nudity and sex of the original novel has been removed in favour of a new (token) black character, a large rubber ""nest creature"" and a *lot* of shooting and marine-type lingo like ""lock and load"" etc...  I guess this makes it more of an ""action"" movie?Despite what the other reviewer says, Sutherland does not overact and is his usual great self, the big flaw in terms of casting is the CREEPY Eric Thal as the lead guy (how can you identify with that?), and the repulsive Julie Warner doing a bad Barbara Streisand impersonation as his sexy??? girlfriend.  (I mean when the damsel is in distress you should want the guy to save her whereas I found myself cheering for her execution.)  The fact that this movie is eight years old now and neither of these two actors have done anything of note since, says it all.All that being said, for some reason I find myself pulling this movie off the shelf much more often that it deserves.  It's a stinker, but somehow comforting to watch over and over again.  Sort of like Christopher Reeve in ""Village of the Damned.""

This little tale of a dysfunctional family was written by Elyse Friedman, a Canadian novelist and screenwriter (Then Again, Long Short Story, Waking Beauty) whose works are summed up by the author: ""If I had to sum up [my characters] in one word, I'd say `outsiders.' There's not one particular source from where I get my inspiration. It comes from different places. I get it from life, and ideas pop into my head. I file them away and sooner or later it's time to deal with them, whether in screenplay, book, or poem or whatever it happens to be."" Craig Lucas (Longtime Companion, Prelude to a Kiss, The Dying Gaul) joins Friedman in bringing this strange little story about outsiders and insiders, all living together under one bizarre roof.Morrie (Matthew Perry) is the older brother who raised his free-spirited siblings Jay (Ben Foster) and Ida (Ginnifer Goodwin) after the death of their parents. Their lives have gone in different directions: Morrie is a professor in line for tenure that happens to be at the mercy of his fellow academician Paul (Gary Wilmes) who lives next door to Morrie and his sturdy but 'it's time to start a family' wife Betty (Lauren Graham). Paul and his obsessive compulsive gardening wife-new-mother Laura (Hilary Swank) do all the right things, a trait Morrie and Betty try to emulate to assure Morrie's getting tenured, a move that will assure Betty that motherhood can be approached.Into this strained atmosphere drops Jay recovering from an accident (he lay on the freeway and was hit but not killed).  Alone (he is married to a young girl Gillian (Zo Kravitz) but does not share this information at first) Jay moves into Morrie's attic and continues his strange life pattern, imposing his Vegan style on the family and eventually inviting his equally looney sister Ida to move in, too: Ida takes the basement. The two siblings proceed to cause minor crises and dilemmas for Morrie, more or less resulting in Morrie's being alienated from his 'important' neighbors.  How Morrie and Betty adjust to their new found way of life and its consequences provides an ending to the story.The film is slight and begs indulgence in some of the sidebars that are less than contributing to the film as a whole, but the cast is very good: Ben Foster and Ginnifer Goodwin continue to impress as they polish their acting skills.  The story is a little on the crazy side, but it does provide another way of viewing a dysfunctional family.  Grady Harp, March 11",4.0,1.0,14,1,0.0,neutral,0.5755,positive,2011,3,6

Garfunkle, Charles Grodin, Jon Voight, of course Alan Arkin (who was really good I thought), Osen Welles (great as the general), the guy who played Welles' step son was great, and many others. Hot chicks too. And Nichols wasn't afraid to show tit.I love seeing intelligent comedies that are directed with a sense of art to them. Like Coen Brothers movies or Rushmore, or Polanski. Comedies don't have to be shot poorly. Not just &quot;point-and-shoot&quot; like most directors do.  Anyway, I would totally tell you to check out this movie. At times it was a little slow and a tad cold feeling, but it's intelligent, funny, bizarre, and very worth watching.",4.0,0.625,1,2,0.4404,positive,0.9868,very positive,2001,7,23

All I know is this movie was pretty funny and kinda sad.  This movie was released in the late 80's, and basically tries to show the what the director believes are inequities between the working class schlubs and rich, management types.  The thing that seemed to come through for me was the issue of greed.  I don't think greed in and of itself is all that bad, but when you make decisions that adversely effect thousands of peoples ability to economically support themselves soley on the basis to fatten your bottom line, or increase your annual bonus, or buy that third or fourth house, then maybe something is wrong.  I don't have a problem with some people having a lot of money, but when said fortunes are gotten through deceiving and cheating those doing the work that produces said fortunes, that doesn't seem right.  It's interesting that this was made almost 15 years ago and just recently we've witnessed the excessiveness of a number of CEOs within the last year or two, and how their actions have affected those that worked for the companies, Enron, Tyco, Worldcom, etc.  Is Michael Moore some kind of prophet?  I don't think so...but he could remake this movie today with any number of individuals involved in the current scandals.  I have heard many critics say he takes things out of context, misrepresents the truth, and edits scenes or even removes them to make his point.  Maybe this is true or not, I don't know, but I do know this was pretty funny and I think a lot of people on both sides should lighten up.

They must stop a crazy Doctor McCoy from altering human history. Joan Collins played Edith Keeler. She's an empathic, educated social worker who helps poor people during The Great Depression.The Trouble With Tribbles: The crew of the USS Enterprise deal with benign animals known as Tribbles and Klingon spies.

The episode tried to give a rational explanation for the Klingon's change in superficial appearance.Balance of Terror: The USS Enterprise must keep a Romulan ship from getting into Federation Space after it destroys a human outpost. There's a lot of Cold War satire in this episode.

I like  it ,  almost, the overall size is great and each DVD has its own sleeve so I am not worried about handling damage. I do agree that 14 DVDs could have been housed  on one  side and 14  on the other to make things smarter easier and just better.second...the attention to detail is still off....just looking at the first DVD shows that. They call one episode ""Hard Contact"" its actually ""Hard Contract"" which Anchor Bay correctly titled...3rd....I quickly went to season seven to see how the end of the series would look etc..the weird thing is that I'm sure that is NOT  Darlane Fluegel pictured on the DVDs with Fred Dryer but some other actress....why? Because they didn't pay much attention to  detail (see first above)... and OH my some of the replacement music is beyond ghastly its horrible and TOO LOUD...ruining scenes that I  watched as  the actual dialog was hard to hear...and the episode times on the first disc of Season seven ran from 42 minutes to  48 minutes plus? NO two episodes had the same time and there were several minutes off so I think  I can safely assume that footage has been lost/cut for whatever reason.GOOD NEWS?  I picked it  up when Amazon.com knocked the price down to $55 range so I can't really complain about 152 episodes for that price...  I can't give it 5 stars because 5 star items should be the best you can find on this site and its just not in that league...but it may be a 5 star value at the price I got mine  for.Don't expect perfection and you will enjoy this romp down memory lane...It almost works  for me!OH..and lest I forget...the original season 1 on Anchor Bay has a bonus DVD with a half hour worth of interviews with Stephen J Cannell and Stepfanie Kramer which is really fun...if you find it used I'd grab it and add it to this collection to make it more complete.",4.0,0.8571428571428571,5,1,0.0,neutral,0.9792,very positive,2010,8,23
896269,B0007Z2KF6,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,1,1,2014-06-08,"A much better DVD presentation, but there is the canned music","The pros when it comes to season 3 (and beyond) are that the double sided DVDs are gone, and you get full seasons of the show.  Season 3 has 23 episodes vs the 8 and 7 for the first two seasons.  The con is, of course, some (but not all) of the original music from the series is gone and replaced with canned instrumental music.  Some of the original songs are still there.  Most of the replacement music are in Chris' scenes in the radio station.  I do not have the old episodes on tape and do not remember the original songs off the top of my head (I was a teenager when the show aired, and did not pay a ton of attention to the music) so I am not sure what the original songs were, but you can tell when a replacement was dropped in.Obviously a main sticking point when it comes to releasing old shows on DVD is getting the rights to the music.  NE is certainly not the only show it has happened to, but it was a show where music was a large part of the show and not always just on in the background.  The reality is that Universal could not just release the DVDs with original music without getting permission from all the rights holders to all the songs.  If they did they would be sued.  The big controversy when the first couple seasons got released on DVD was the high cost (especially since there were so few episodes) because they paid for the rights to all the songs and passed it on to the consumer.  Now yes, you can be mad that they were too cheap to continue to pay whatever it takes to get all the songs, but these days the only way to see the show is in this format.  It is not on in syndication any longer, so unless you taped it on VHS years ago, there would be no way to see it.  So you have to make the choice about whether or not having all the music will ruin your enjoyment of the show to an extent that you could never watch it any other way.The third season begins to abandon Joel's ""fish out of water"" feeling, and starts to focus on more of the ancillary characters and the town itself.  It also expands on the sexual tension and ""will they/wont they"" aspect to the Joel and Maggie relationship.  Toward the end of the season you started to see less of Rob Morrow because he was starting to have contract issues with the producers.  As a result many of the episodes began what would continue into the remaining seasons of focusing on other story lines.  The show had very high quality acting and writing however, so even though they began reducing his role the show remained entertaining.As far as extras go, there are deleted and/or extended scenes for every episode on each disc.  The last disc has a few different gag reels and some unaired storylines.  There are no commentaries or interviews with cast members at all, but for what is there, the material is good.  The A/V quality is about what you would expect for a DVD presentation of a show that is now over 20 years old.  Not great, but better than what you would get on VHS. If you can accept not having all the music, it is definitely worth picking up because the show is wonderful, and this is probably the best overall season.  If the music thing bothers you too much, then skip it.",4.0,1.0,2,2,0.2382,positive,0.7647,very positive,2014,6,8

1119947,B000YIGNBS,A29VKODW4R5U7W,2,3,2008-03-24,Beautiful meditative film from Thailand... Fine DVD from Strand,"This was a pleasure to watch. Quite unlike anything I've seen before. It is an impressionistic film, filled with Buddhist ideas and dwelling on several metaphysical concepts; on the cyclical nature of life, of time, of history; on the duality of reality and of the male and female halves of creation. There is no actual story or plot. The film is split into two halves. Each half is a reflection of the other with slight alterations. Reality viewed through the Looking Glass. It isn't a film that tells you things. It seeks to provoke thought, reflection, meditation and perhaps in the end a better understanding of life.Both halves centre around medical staff working in Thailand. The first half is set in the near past, roughly 20-30 years ago. In a rural district hospital. The second half takes place in present day Thailand in a spanking new multi-story hospital in Bangkok. The actors are the same in both halves and they play roughly the same characters with the same names but in different settings.In the first half, the lady doctor, Dr. Toey, interviews a male intern Dr. Nohng coming over from the army to work in the civilian sector. She is also dogged by a shy soldier who is besotted with her. Even as she turns him down, she remembers an earlier relationship with a handsome young Orchid Farmer whom she herself was attracted to but who was similarly interested in someone else. Cycles of unrequited love, never-ending. Meanwhile, the hospital's resident dentist croons Thai country ballads to his patients in an airy treatment room surrounded by banana palms and sunlight. In his free time, he performs at the local open air concerts. It is a bucolic setting filled with nostalgia for the recent past. The entire first half is filled with the sound of birds, crickets, rustling leaves and gently flowing water.The second half again begins with the lady doctor, also called Dr. Toey, interviewing Dr. Nohng the army doctor who is coming over to work in the hospital. Unlike in the first half where he confesses to a fear of blood, Dr. Nohng is now a haematologist (blood specialist). The second half focuses more on Nohng's love life. Here love is reciprocated. He has a much more intimate relationship with his executive girlfriend who also wants him to move out with her to a less bustling city, out in the country, near the beach. The dentist no longer sings country ballads. He works in a sterile white and cold facility somewhere in the bowels of the modern city hospital. He spends his free time as an aerobics instructor. The soundscape here is sterile, filled with the mechanical hum of electrical appliances and soulless machines. Gentle Thai country ballads have given way to loud thumping rock music.All throughout though, we see the mainstays of Thai society. Saffron robed monks coming to hospital for treatment. Always smiling and trailing their aura of peace. Young conscript soldiers dressed in plain green fatigues in the first half are replaced by young conscripts in newer jungle camouflage in the second. Hard to tell apart. Things change and yet things stay the same. Statues of the Buddha are everywhere. As are statues of the beloved King - regarded by practically all Thais as the embodiment of the ideal Buddhist King. Holdovers from the ancient past still remain. Even in medical practice. Senior doctors practise ""Chakra Healing"" without batting an eyelid even as they interpret CT-scans amidst all the paraphernalia of modern medicine. By using the same actors, and characters with the same names, in both halves, Director Apichatpong Weerasethakul also highlights how no matter how times and situations may change the people will always remain the same.In both halves we also hear discussions on reincarnation. The concept may be foreign to many westerners but the discussions raise universal themes - how to heal relationships sundered by death; how to make peace with the past; given a chance to be reborn, and a choice of incarnations, which would be preferable? In this world, would it be better to be born male or female, rich or poor, human or animal? It is a simple film and for many a film about nothing at all. Yet it is the richest film I have seen in ages.The film is in Thai. My only gripe with this DVD is that the English subtitles are permanently burnt onto the print and cannot be turned off. They are distracting, especially on rewatching.

In a touching display young Phillipe lies to Scotland Yard investigators to protect his friend and ally Richardson.Reed creates an aura of suspense and tension as the investigators roam through the mansion searching for clues and trying to pin a murder on Richardson.

20877,0767836286,A2198FZZMTJ38H,0,1,2001-02-10,Packs a punch of twists and power!,"&quot;Arlington Road&quot; is a large breath of fresh air for the suspense genre, giving new life to the meaning of the word &quot;originality.&quot; It's full of splendid ideas and plot twists, it has an ensemble of characters that we care about and watch, and it has one of the best and most satisfying movie endings I've ever seen on film. It's a story of one man's battle against his not-so-nice neighbors while also being a personal battle as he sinks into the depths of paranoia and uncertainty.Right from the beginning, the movie begins packing in the chills. A small boy is walking down the center of a road with his hand severely bloodied and scorched, when he is snatched up by Michael Faraday, a resident of Arlington Road, and rushed off to the emergency room. The scene as a whole is charged with a unique blend of close-ups and unsettling bass impacts from the soundtrack which will set the tone for the rest of the movie. Faraday soon meets the boy's parents at the hospital, Oliver and Cheryl Lang, and converses with them about their son before returning to his home, where he confides to his girlfriend Brooke that he felt bad for not knowing the boy's name.As the movie progresses, it takes its time in revealing the climax that is to come. We learn that Faraday is a college professor who teaches a class on terrorism in America. He once was married to an FBI agent who was killed in a massacre of right wing activists in the woods. His memories haunt him at certain moments in the film, but instead of dragging it out, these memories serve as the reason for which Faraday becomes so wrapped up in the true history and character of his neighbors, the Langs.A mysterious letter addressed to someone of a different name also has Oliver's name on it, which leads Faraday to discover some secret blueprints when he returns the letter to his neighbor. He begins to become more uncertain and uncomfortable with the situation, and dives into a discreet investigation of Lang's past, discovering that he changed his name numerous times, and that he was once arrested for constructing pipe bombs on his father's farm. Whlie this heavily raises his suspicions of Oliver, Oliver is able to calm Faraday's notion that he is dangerous, and sets his mind at ease with an explanation of morality for his change of name.It is at this point that the film picks up to an incredible pace, but to tell you anymore would ruin the many surprises it has to offer. Brooke begins to realize that Michael may be right in his suspicions, which leads her into danger. Faraday is given the ultimate ultimatum by Oliver, who, by this point in the movie, has every aspect of his neighbor's life bugged and tapped. He is keeping close dibs on Faraday, and it is evident by this time that Faraday is not paranoid. What he knows can destroy his life, but he is about to become someone who will be remembered on a much grander scale, and in the ending, he will serve as a model for his own teachings and opinions.Throughout the whole movie, there is never a moment where we are not involved in some sort of race against time, in which Faraday must try to bring his criminal neighbors out into the open for the world to see. This allows for a highly introspective look at Faraday, who is seen as becoming obsessed with his notions and discoveries. The people in his life, his close friends and family, do not believe him when he tries to disclose his findings, so this leaves the intensity up to actor Jeff Bridges, who carries it on his shoulders with a stunning ability all his own.The story as a whole is highly original and complex, involving and impacting. It's really two stories rolled into one: one is the struggle of a man to stop a deadly event from happening, and another is the struggle of the same man to deal with what he finds out and make sure that he is correct and not passing false judgement. The second story works out because actor Tim Robbins and actress Joan Cusack are able to make the audience as well as Faraday believe that they are not what he accuses them of being. They play out the actions and manipulations perfectly, and even when we realize they have a dark and frightening side, they carry it off so well.With every other thriller basing its story on old ideas and scripts, &quot;Arlington Road&quot; is a hostile and inviting film that breaks free of the moorings of simplicity and chooses to give us a movie that keeps us in suspense until the gut-punch ending, which will leave you absolutely breathless. We care for the characters, we enjoy the story, and we get a terrifically twisted look at the lives of those who are not what they appear to be on the outside.",4.0,0.0,3,2,0.0,neutral,0.6772,very positive,2001,2,10

Mainly because I had never read the comic book 'Hellblazer', that inspired the film.  Then I saw the preview and it looked like a very entertaining sci-fi/religious thrill ride in the vein of 'The Prophecy' series, ""End of Days"", and ""Hellboy"", plus Keanu looked pretty cool in one of his first post-'Matrix' action films.""Constantine"" is based on the popular Vertigo/DC Comic 'Hellblazer', which follows the demon hunting exploits of its hero John Constantine (Keanu Reeves).  Constantine is a chain smoking, wise-cracking, selfish demon hunter, whose primary goal in life is to send as many of Hell's minions back to where they belong and hopefully work his way into Heaven.  During his quest he is aided by Chaz (Shia Lebouf), Papa Midnight (Djimon Hounsou), and a seemingly duplictious angel named Gabriel (Tilda Swinton).  When a cop (Rachel Weisz) discovers her twin sister has seemingly committed suicide, she enlists the aide of Constantine in discovering what exactly happened to her God-fearing sister to cause her to end her life.  This mystery only deepens as Constantine discovers that demons are attempting to crossover into Earth's realm, and this cop, when coupled with the mythic Spear of Destiny, is the key.With terrific special effects, most notably the imaginative interpretation of Hell as being an alternate reality, so that it appears to be a constantly buring Los Angeles.  Pitch-perfect performances by the cast, that bring depth and reality to their comic book counterparts, and fast-paced editing and directing from first time movie director Francis Lawrence, ""Constantine"" is sci-fi/religious thriller that is guaranteed to keep you entertained.Though, not entirely faithful to the comic book according to fan boys and the movies own making of featurette admits this, the film is an enjoyable comic book adaptation.  The theology for the movie is steeped primarily in Catholicism, even then it's not an accurate depiction of the faith, definitely not a movie to base your religious beliefs on, but then again it never aspired for that purpose.  As I said earlier, it appeared this one would be another one of the great sci-fi/religious thrillers, and I was right.  If you enjoyed 'The Prophecy' series, ""Hellboy"", 'The Omen' franchise, or ""End of Days"", then this movie is for you.With the great success of ""Constantine"" hopefully Warner Brothers will realize the potential in this film for a franchise, especially since Keanu Reeves, Rachel Weisz, and Djimon Hounsou have all expressed interest in returning, and treat audiences to more demon hunting with ""Constantine 2"".""Constantine"" is rated R for violence and language.",4.0,0.0,4,2,0.0,neutral,0.9918,very positive,2005,8,1

In this DVD he presents two sides of a story. On one hand he interviews a man who has lost his faith. On the other he himself represents a man who has gained faith. It was interesting to see how he answered questions Charles Templeton struggled with. This DVD addresses questions like:How can God be loving if there is suffering, disease and death?Is there only one way to God?Is it OK to have doubts and still be a Christian?Why do the major religions of the world contradict each other?Which religion has the true answers to solve life's major dilemmas?Some of the answers will put your mind at ease. After watching this you will understand the source of evil. You will also understand that it is OK to have doubts.What I came away with was that compared with eternity with God, this life is fairly insignificant. The fact that we are strengthened by our troubles was also reinforced.I think if you feel uncertainty and confusion this might be one of the DVDs you are supposed to watch.While most of this DVD is beautifully done there are a few images that may be disturbing. Mostly they have to do with death. Probably nothing you haven't seen on the news.One thing you should not miss out on while watching this movie is the extra bonus documentaries.

This is one of my favorite (small) Nicholas Cage films.  There are no special effects here.  Everything is carried along skillfully with the pure acting talents of its four main characters.  Cage gets caught up in a somewhat complicated plot between a married couple who both want to murder each other.  Adding to the threatening mayhem is Dennis Hopper who is in top form as a killer-for-hire.  Who has the upper-hand at any given moment shifts around, but other than Cage, it's topsy turvey over the motives of the married couple, and exactly what Hopper will settle for.  The ending is right on the money.

249450,6301302990,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,107,107,2006-06-30,Entertaining Murder Mystery & Impressive Early Example of Noir Visual Style.,"""I Wake Up Screaming"" was the first film noir made at 20th Century Fox. Its greatest distinction is its visual style whose low-key lighting and dark shadows would become archetypal of film noir after World War II. Cinematographer Edward Cronjager created a striking early example of ""noir"" lighting -what John Alton appropriately called ""mystery lighting""- in this film made in 1941, before the United States entered the War. The story is based on the novel of the same name by Stephen Fisher, adapted for the screen by Dwight Taylor, who moved the action to New York, gave it a flashback structure, and turned it into one of those hybrids so common in pre-War Hollywood that combines multiple genres: Mystery, romance, musical (the singing scene was cut), comedy, suspense, and psychological drama. But the suspense does dominate.When model and aspiring actress Vicky Lynn (Carole Landis) is murdered, the police are quick to blame Frankie Christopher (Victor Mature), a fight promoter who met Vicky when she was a waitress, introduced her to all the right people, and managed her ascent to glamour girl -until she left him for Hollywood. Vicky's down-to-earth sister Jill (Betty Grable) disapproved of her career choice but doesn't want to believe Frankie responsible for her death. The Assistant District Attorney thinks early on that the creepy switchboard operator (Elisha Cook, Jr.) at the Lynns' apartment building is the killer, but sadistic police detective Ed Cornell (Laird Cregar) won't let up on Frankie, constantly harassing and threatening him, leaving Frankie little choice but to find the killer himself.""I Wake Up Screaming"" opens with an eyecatching credit sequence of names in lights sprawled across a dark cityscape. That got my attention. Then we move on to an interrogation room at the police station. Frankie Christopher is harshly lit with one lamp, surrounded by police officers in the shadows. Gorgeous, dramatic, low-key lighting. The faces of some characters, even Frankie, are sometimes completely blacked out. I don't know if that is due to a film with limited tonal range or if it's deliberate. But it's daring. Everywhere we go in the station house, there are bars and shadows. The implication that the characters are trapped as if in a cage is overwhelming. The police station is like a template for film noir aesthetic. This really surprised me in such an early film, but it's fabulous.This was Betty Grable's first non-musical role. She's all sweetness and goodness, but she is also level-headed, practical, and brave in the mold of a film noir helper-heroine. Unfortunately, every time she appears on screen we hear ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", which eventually drove me a little nuts. Victor Mature makes a strong and appealing protagonist. But the stand-out performance comes from Laird Cregar as the very creepy, obsessed police detective Cornell. He's truly unsettling and one of the most memorable noir villains. The dialogue isn't hard-boiled except for a few lines delivered by Vicky. But ""I Wake Up Screaming"" is a superb example of the film noir style as it was entering Hollywood's visual vocabulary.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006):  A few scenes show some white specks and lines, but this print is generally good. Sound is good. Bonus features: A deleted scene called ""Daddy"" (4 min), in which Betty Grable sings. This doesn't fit the tone of the movie well, so it was best left out. ""Hot Spot"" (text) is a brief account of the film's title change from ""I Wake Up Screaming"" to ""Hot Spot"" and back again. We can watch the opening credits for the film with the ""Hot Spot"" title (1 min). There are 3 ""Still Galleries"": A Poster Gallery (3 posters), a Production Stills Gallery of behind-the-scenes photos (8), and a Unit Photography Gallery of publicity stills (38 photos). It's interesting to note that scenes are much more brightly lit in the publicity stills than in the movie itself. There is a theatrical trailer (2 min). Film noir historian Eddie Muller delivers a good, nearly constant audio commentary. He compares the screenplay to Steven Fisher's novel, provides background information for many of the creative crew and actors, discusses the noir visual style and the juxtaposition of light and dark thematic elements in the film. Muller speaks a lot about the people involved in the film, as always. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish.",4.0,1.0,10,2,0.128,neutral,0.9807,very positive,2006,6,30

He's a prolific writer so it's not as if there isn't enough material to work from.  In this case, besides writing the screenplay, Koontz also serves as one of the producers.  (Which puts this under the heading of: you only have yourself to blame.)The plot can best be compressed into the category of things that go bump in the night.  The occupants of a town go missing, some bodies and body parts are found along with hardware ranging from teeth to a pacemaker (there's also quite a collection of wrist watches, things not easily digested).  A thingy is afoot, roaming freely through the sewers.  It absorbs people and ideas like flatworms.  It can also make itself tangible.  For all that, Phantoms isn't nearly clever or scary enough to prove a horror masterpiece.  But it does try (at times more trying than tried).  For me the weakest link is the twitchy-gimmicky performance by Liev Schreiber.  It's never established why this character (Deputy Wargle) is instantly/automatically bizarre.  Was he always like this and if so, how could he maintain a job for any length of time acting like a space cadet.  If he `changed' as a result of being in this town, why didn't the others also change as well?  Every time I watch this movie, that's the one thing that jumps out as wrong.As for wasting the considerable talents of Peter O'Toole, that's a charge I won't level.  I'd watch the man read from a phone book.  He can make crap seem brilliant.  He's easily the best thing in this movie and makes this a guilty pleasure to watch.For some reason, this movie feels like a variant of (the remake of) The Blob.

Ala in 'North by Northwest' you never are confident believing what Cary Grant's character says. Hepburn is playfully fun ala her role in 'How to Steal a Million' and Walter Matthau is an additional stand out, giving a superb performance ala his in 'Charlie Varick,' displaying his serious determined side of his acting talents.  This film has nothing obviously in common with 'The Great Escape,' but like that film wherein different people have their favorite character and will wait until that character's next appearance on the screen this a hard movie to change the channel on, since you want to see each succeeding scene and want to see the chase wrapped up even though you may have seen it 10 times and are thoroughly aware of how that occurs.

Yes, there are a lot of discrepancies in the way this 2-disc DVD set is described and advertised, but there is some fine footage on these DVDs.  First, the '84 disc is NOT a Mahavishnu Orchestra concert.  It is the group called Mahavishnu, which WAS started by John McLaughlin, but it bares little resemblance to the MO of the 70s.  For one thing, the violinist is replaced by reed man (sax & oboe) Bill Evans.  Plus, McLaughlin plays mostly guitar-synth...although there are a few excellent rocking guitar solos in this concert, John stays with the guitar-synth on most of the performance.  Still, his playing is incredible, as are his compositions.  His totally revamped personnel also features drummer Danny Gottlieb from the Pat Metheny Group.  The mood is different than the M. Orchestra, but it's still pure McLaughlin!!  It was a great show, as long as you realize it is Mahavishnu, NOT the Mahavishnu Orchestra!!  It's still a McLaughlin concert that you ought to see!!  Next, the '74 DVD IS the Mahavishnu Orchestra, but it's NOT the original line-up.  It was the final line-up featuring Jean-Luc Ponty on violin, Gayle Moran (Chick Corea's wife at the time) on keyboards, Ralphe Armstrong on bass and Nerada Michael Walden on drums.  Being a big Jean-Luc fan, this line-up did not bother me at all!  Despite the description this site gives, there are only 2 songs that actually have visual footage of the band.  They do an incredible over-21-minute version of Wings of Karma, followed by a full 28-minute version (even though Gayle had to cut a keyboard solo short due to technical sound problems) of Hymn to Him (both songs from the MO album ""Apocalypse"")  Together, that is nearly 50 minutes of visual footage of a fabulous performance by a great band during an important time in McLaughlin's career.  The following 4 tunes would have been much better with visual coverage OF COURSE....but, this is still a great disc to have, even if you never go past the visual portion of the disc!  I even had a problem where my discs weren't labeled properly.  My '74 disc was labeled '84 and vise versa.  But I still don't care!  These are two great concerts featuring the genius McLaughlin at two entirely different phases in his illustrious career!  And these are worth owning!  I had to knock off a star and give this a 4-star rating because of all the faults and disprepancies etc., but there is still a lot of great stuff to watch for the $14.00 I paid for this thing.  Sure, there are discrepancies, inconsistancies and things, but if you're a McLaughlin fan, you really ought to see this thing!!  Just know what you're getting before you buy it!  But believe me!!  There is some AWESOME McLaughlin (and other great artists too)  Ponty is SMOKING HOT while playing the MO in the '74 disc!!

183290,156219464X,A3KDC5EZSA8AZJ,2,3,2006-02-09,Not your typical kiddie cartoon!,"""Grave of the fireflies"" is an anime film (for the uninititated, anime is the term used to describe a style of animation used by artists in Japan)  markedly different from it's contemporaries in both style and substance.First of all, where most animated films are geared towards young audiences and have plots of juvenile (or worse: I'm talking to you, ""Lilo & Stitch 2"") dimensions, ""Grave of the firefiles"" is a film which instead chooses to tell a story of great emotional maturity and power. The result is undeniably the most moving ""cartoon"" ever made.Seito and Setsuko are two young children living with their mother (their father is away at sea) in the Japanese port city of Kobe at the end of WWII. When Kobe is fire-bombed by enemy (i.e American) planes, the fragile city is destroyed, their mother is killed, and Seito and Setsuko are left to fend for themselves in an indifferent and sometimes hostile environment.You will probably note from this brief synopis that the plot of ""fireflies"" differs considerably from that of the typical ""kiddie cartoon"". Indeed, very few animated films tend to make serious statements about war, let alone involve thoroughly realistic characters and protagonists. But that's just what happens in Isao Takahata's ""Grave of the fireflies"", and, though rather upsetting, the result is pretty damned heart-wrenching stuff.WARNING: Despite being a little broad and simplified (especially about the political situation at the time: Americans, though never mentioned by name, are basically reduced to villains who fly overhead in B-24s and randomly shower people with bombs) with characters (especially Setsuko) whose lines of dialogue are often restricted to things like ""I'm thirsty"" or ""I'm hungry"", this movie is very realistic and is quite a painful and upsetting experience that put a hardened ""serious"" film-goer like myself on the verge of tears, something which rarely happens to me at the movies, let alone a so-called ""cartoon"". But if you see ""Grave of the fireflies"", even if you're not neccessarily a fan of ""Anime"" (I'm not, really), chances are it's surplus of powerful images will make you somewhat moist-eyed as well. It's truly a shocking experience.Just be prepared.",4.0,0.6666666666666666,1,6,0.0,neutral,-0.9875,very negative,2006,2,9
1527057,B00772HQTC,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,4,6,2012-06-13,"Not the quirky comedy the US trailer would have you believe, but quality work from Cedar and Ashkenazi","I'm a huge fan of Lior Ashkenazi's - his winning presence inWalk on WaterandLate Marriagemake those two of my favorite movies.  Likewise, I've enjoyed the previous outings of talented writer/director, the New York-born Joseph Cedar.  Here, Ashkenazi and Cedar join forces for the first time in the Oscar-nominated film, 'Footnote' ('Hearat Shulayim' in its original Israeli release).Trailers in the US would have you believe that 'Footnote' is a quirky little comedy about a quirky family.  Hardly.  'Footnote' is instead a dry, quiet film about a small family drama.  Ashkenazi and Shlomo Bar-Aba play Uriel and Eliezer Shkolnik respectively, the son and father of a Taldumic scholarly duo.  The son - witty, urbane, polished, widely acknowledged and accepted in popular Israeli culture - is everything his father is not.  His father is...difficult, standoffish, ruffled, uncomfortable, inscrutable and known to only the smallest of scholarly circles (he can't even pass through security for a ceremony held for his son).  If you could put a word on Shlomo it would be...autistic (and, indeed, that's the word spat by Uriel's wife during a fit of not undeserved exasperation).The movie turns on a yearly award given out to the top Talmudic scholar (depicted as sort of an in-country Nobel Prize).  Meant to go to the son, the committee errs (a logistical slip-up) and instead notifies the father.  Mortified, the committee consults with Ashkenazi - they want to rescind the prize and give it him instead.  How and where they do that - in a cramped conference room packed tight with hand-wringing committee members - is the film's best sequence.  It possesses a madcap, manic energy that should have inspired the rest of the film.That event sets the film's moral dilemma: Does son Uriel help untangle this mess?  Does he side with the committee and support their desire to strip and reassign the award? (it's only thinly veiled that Ashkenazi's character feels he's deserving).  Or, does he protect his father?  Getting tabbed has clearly brought a sense of vindication and relief to Shlomo...as well to his small circle of supporters.  Son Uriel knows that to revoke the prize may inflict a mortal below.Shlomo, though, with his scholarly bent, begins to piece together a few inconsistencies in the award process.  By the time he's about to enter the stage for the award, he's put 2 & 2 together.Ashkenazi - despite the weight and heavy beard he put on for the role - is magnetic here again in a leading role.  It's a small, enjoyable film...but certainly no world beater and not nearly on the same level as Oscar-winningA Separation [Blu-ray].  The nomination for Cedar was his second. He also scored one for Beaufort.  The nomination process for best foreign film is at best opaque.  How those two films scored nominations while Eran Riklis and Eytan Fox - Israel's two best directors - have thus far been shut-out is beyond me.",4.0,0.6666666666666666,1,1,-0.1419,neutral,0.9984,very positive,2012,6,13

Very important.,"The Believer (Henry Bean, 2001)Veteran screenwriter Henry Bean (Internal Affairs, Deep Cover) steps behind the camera for the first time in The Believer, which stars Ryan Gosling (Breaker High) as an anti-Semitic fascist who also happens to be a Jew. The movie premiered at Sundance in 2001 to great acclaim, then was shelved halfway through a distribution deal thanks to protests from the Simon Wiesenthal Center. (It finally did a achieve a very limited theatrical release in May of 2002 in New York City, but for most of the country, it's straight-to-video.)The film is roughly what one would expect from this kind of film being made in today's political climate; bad boy surrounds himself with other bad boys, but finds redemption in the end. The beauty of the film, however, lies in how Gosling's character achieves redemption (it could, in fact, be argued that he never does; he is without doubt conflicted until, and after, the movie's very last frame). Rather than the ""befriend a minority"" tactic of American History X or the ""let's listen to holocaust survivors"" tactic of a hundred other previous films (both of which, in fact, get some airplay here with much more realistic results), the main character in the film starts conflicted; he just doesn't realize it, although we are given enough clues from the get-go to understand what's going on in his head before he does. Once he finally does get it, he's intelligent enough to realize what's going on and fear it, while still desiring it, in some way. In other words, he might be the most intelligent main character in a movie since movies were invented. There's no point after he realizes what's going on where you look at the screen and yell ""don't go in the basement, stupid!"" That alone is enough to make this film noteworthy (and probably banish it into undeserved obscurity forever, since getting something out of this movie requires thought on the part of the viewer-anathema to American moviegoers, for the most part). Because of all this, the movie ends up being extremely unsettling in ways that are impossible to describe. Gosling and Bean force you to identify with Gosling's character, no matter how little you have in common with him, by making him as much an Everyman as possible given his extreme viewpoint (even the other fascists with whom he associates consider him something of a walking time bomb, though they don't hesitate to try and use him to their own ends).This is not necessarily a film to be enjoyed, but it is an important one.

687260,B00005V3Z4,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,11,13,2005-12-21,"""It's A Wonderful Life"" All Over Again","I have never been a huge fan of ""Donnie Darko"" as a science fiction story, which is how it was intended by writer/director Richard Kelly. The vague storytelling masks the gaps in logic and the budgetary constraints that did not allow them to show things more convincingly (also Kelly needed more experience before he tackled a project of this scope). However, fans have embraced this failing as the film's strength and have used the open-ended structure to mold the thing into something that fits their own individual agendas.By now most everyone knows that early in the film the world diverges into a tangent universe, a situation that must be remedied in 28 days or the normal universe will end. Donnie has been selected by some undisclosed guardian to bring the tangent and primary universes back into alignment. He is given some superhuman powers for this task but only a few clues about what must be done. Searching for answers (mostly about time travel) during the day and performing sleepwalking pranks by night (an inefficient way to bring about certain vaguely tangential events), he semi-cluelessly moves forward toward the deadline. At last he figures out that he must send an ""artifact"" (a jet engine) back from the tangent universe to the normal universe. He seemingly knows that doing so will result in his death in the normal universe but he selflessly performs the task and restores things to a stable balance.This is not as silly and contrived as it sounds but it does have some major issues that must be ignored if one is to really embrace the film. It also lacks useful philosophical depth and is just a teen movie with some intriguing thoughts about time travel.But ""Donnie Darko"" becomes extraordinary when viewed instead as an allegorical story about free will versus destiny. It is basically a twisted remake of Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"", with Donnie a 1988 version of George Bailey and Frank his guardian angel. Instead of being given a chance to see what the world would be like if he had not been born, Donnie is given the chance to see how his continued existence would alter events. For George Bailey the experience was full of positive revelations, for Donnie it is the opposite.To go with this unintended interpretation you just dismiss the whole thing about tangent universes. Instead Donnie dies at the beginning of the story by a random event (a jet engine falls off a plane passing over his house)over which he has no control. Since he is not essential to the event, he is given a chance to experience an additional 28 days of life to see the effects of his remaining alive and then choose between the two alternate futures. But he is also given the ability to actually see the force fields that draw everyone toward their destinies and finds himself powerless to resist such manipulation. Ultimately he makes his first ""free choice"" and elects his original death.""Heathers"" was a major influence on Kelly and ""Donnie Darko"" has that same sedated tone, with characters generally under-reacting to absurdly extreme developments. As in that film parents are not the problem, rather it is kids being incredibly (but believably) cruel to each other.The cast is solid although avoiding Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze is normally a good idea. Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent and it is nice that his actual sister Maggie plays his film sister. Unfortunately both Maggie and Jena Malone are wasted in unchallenging roles with minimal screen time.Then again, what do I know?

The year is 1957 and a group of soviet soldiers break into a secret military base with an aged Indiana Jones. They want him to lead them to a box containing a mysterious mummified corpse which will help lead them to the powerful yet mysterious crystal skull. When they manage to locate the crystal skull and return it to its original resting place, unknown powers will be unleashed that if returned by the leading soviet lady Irina Spalko, it could mean a drastic turn in the cold war for the west.Now myself, like many others were doubtful that a fourth Indiana Jones film could work just as well as the originals. Not to sound ageist but the age of Harrison Ford was one of the main concerns when playing such a role. Literally from the first few scenes starting with the warehouse, my doubts were squashed. Harrison seemed on form with his action sequences, although I'm sure the stunt double played a particularly larger part in this instalment. Accompanying Indy on his missions this time around is a young, cocky, motorcycle riding 60s clich&eacute; called Mutt (LaBeouf). Don't worry though because this instalment isn't just starring one original cast member as an old Raiders of the Lost Ark love interest Marian Ravenwood comes back to reclaim Indy's heart. Oh and she's also Mutts mother, see the connection there?The action for this film is easily the best I've seen from any Indy film and that's including the classic boulder scene. Of course the CGI was destined to play a big part in a new Indy film and it really does. That doesn't take anything away from it, however, as the CG really is flawless and presents the environments with a genuine rapport to them.Overall it's a genuinely good film, the ending is a bit random and in some ways disappointing. It keeps the classic humorous moments in over the top situations, I have a genuine respect for Harrison Ford for what he's done in this film. He's shown that he can still hang with the young action stars of today and it definitely had its passing of the torch moment in relation to LaBeouf. I would recommend it to any film lover and wouldn't separate it from the entire Indy series as it's definitely kept the trend of being a satisfying action movie.",4.0,0.4285714285714285,4,9,-0.5647,negative,0.9971,very positive,2008,10,10

Requiring some massive suspension of disbelief, and putting aside logic, the story is as solid as a house of cards.  It's hard to imagine that a child could actually disappear without a trace, but this tale is told with so much emotion and bravado, and pretense is carried forward with such bold confidence, that much like a magician's grand illusion, you go along with the trick, while speculating on how it might be done.  The film plays with the audience, dangling the possibility that the missing girl may not even be real, as a great effort is made to pump up the drama and tension.  Unfortunately, the movie falters down the stretch, as the rationale behind the elaborate scheme, is less than totally convincing.Few can bring the kind off relentless determination and righteous maternal outrage to a role, like Jodie Foster, who similar to a pit bull, refuses to give up, and seems at times to cross the line between sanity and madness.  Although Peter Sarsgaard and Sean Bean give strong performances, they are each overpowered by Foster's electric presence.Kyle Pratt (Foster) is an aircraft engineer working in Berlin, whose husband has just died in an accident.  The widow, along with her six year old daughter Julia (Marlene Lawson), are on a flight to New York City, with her husband's casket in the hold.  Pratt falls asleep, and finds her daughter missing when she wakes up.  Unable to locate Julia, Pratt begins to assert herself.  Matters soon escalate to involve air marshal Gene Carson (Sarsgaard) and the pilot Captain Rich (Bean), who has his crew conduct a search of the plane.  No signs of the girl are found, and those in charge begin to doubt Pratt, because no one remembers seeing Julia, there is no record of her boarding, and Pratt has ""lost"" her daughter's boarding pass.A supercritical element is that Kyle Pratt helped design the E-474, the same type of aircraft that she is flying in.  Her Intimate knowledge of the plane's construction and layout, helps her to evade capture, travel through restricted areas, and affect the plane's functions, when she goes ""rogue"", attempting to locate her daughter without regard for anyone else.Playing out with some similarities to the old TV series Banacek, Flightplan has a number of large plot holes, starting with no one on the plane seeing Julia.  Exploring these faults in detail, would lead to some major spoilers, so suffices to say, that after the identity of the perpetrators is revealed, the story becomes even more outlandish, as the authorities play almost no role in what happens, and Pratt goes into full action hero mode.This is a first rate production, with high quality special effects, unique sets for fictional cutting edge jet, and even a high tech coffin.  The plane's design, interiors, operational systems, storage hold, and equipment layout, are more fantasy than reality, but it hardly seems to matter.  In a breakthrough effort, director Robert Schwentke (The Time Traveler's Wife,Red) delivers the kind of film you would expect from a Brian Grazer production, and one that should please Jodie Foster fans.  Appearing in films likePanic Room(2002) andThe Brave One(2007), Foster continues to impress in physically demanding roles.  Schwentke delves into the filmmaking process, and eloquently explains and analyzes his vision, in a rather comprehensive commentary.The reality in Flightplan feels very much like your typical airplane disaster movie, as the story attempts to manipulate its audience on a grand scale.

700160,B000065U36,A2PBV1899CX3TE,0,0,2008-07-26,I'll take that as a maybe,"Orange County is about a guy from Orange County who wants to be a writer. He feels stifled by the O.C., but if he could only get into Stanford then things would change. Everyone in Orange County is an idiot except him, it seems (sorry Orange County, I don't mean to disparage your intelligence. That is just what I gather from this movie. Besides, I'm the last one to talk, since I am in Bakersfield). In some ways it is like Finding Forrester, but not nearly as good. It is a light comedy with Shaun Brumder's (Colin Hanks) quest for Stanford and a writing career functioning more as an excuse for zany antics and slapstick.Colin Hanks is the son of actor Tom Hanks. He doesn't do so badly, but it is hard not to compare him to his father. His girlfriend Ashley is played by Schuyler Fisk, who is the daughter of Sissy Spacek. She is a cute red head, and she looks a lot like her mother. Both Colin and Schuyler (pronounced Skyler) were perfectly adequate, and let's give them a chance to carve out their own identities.In a film about someone wanting to write, I am always curious about who wrote the film. Is it autobiographical? I think that clearly it is, as it was written by Mike White who could very well be from Orange County, or at least Southern California. He wrote a few episodes of Freaks and Geeks, and also a lot of his projects involve the talents of Jack Black. Funny how the two are like opposites, Black and White, yet they work together so much. As well as Orange County, Mike White also wrote scripts for The School of Rock and Nacho Libre.Mike White acts, too, but mostly kind of nerdy character roles like Ned Schneebly in The School of Rock, or in this film, he plays high school English teacher, Mr. Burke.Mr. Burke: Now, when I say ""Romeo and Juliet,"" who comes to mind?Dana: Claire Danes?Mr. Burke: That's right, Claire Danes. Who else?Chad: Leonardo DiCaprio.Mr. Burke: Right. Who else? Well, you know someone else was involved in that movie who in some ways is as famous as Leonardo Di Caprio. And his name is William Shakespeare. And some great movies have been made based on his plays: Hamlet, West Side Story, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Waterworld, Gladiator, Chocolat...As you can see, Shaun really does need to escape the idiots in Orange County. Mr. Burke likes Shaun's story, though.Mr. Burke: Shaun! I read your story. You used a lot of big words. Great! Good for you! It was a little long, so I didn't read the whole thing, but who cares 'cause I gave you an A!Catherine O'Hara was good as Shaun's mother, Cindy Beugler. She played a lush housewife very well, a little too well so I wondered if it was merely acting? She is from Second City TV, and was in Best of Show and A Mighty Wind.Jack Black has a few scenes where he really steals the show. At first his Lance Brumder is just a drug addled loser, the kind of role Jack could play in his sleep with one hand tied behind his back. Is he just going to phone it in? But then when they take a road trip to Stanford, the old Black magic is back. He breaks into the Admissions office and when he gets caught, he attempts to seduce the secretary. Hilarity ensues.Kevin Kline plays the professor and writer that Shaun wants to go to Stanford to study with. There is a scene where he finally does get to meet him and he gets some advice and a critique of his story. Life is not always Black and White, and sometimes there are various shades of Orange County involved. The only thing is, the last bit of advice he gives could apply to the movie that we are watching just as well: The story needs a better ending.Jack Black Rules!!!!!King Kong (Widescreen Edition)(2005) ....

It's a heist film, but what makes it different from others is that it is more concerned with the consequences of the heist than the actual robbery itself. Unfortunately, the movie failed to meet my expectations, which may have been set too high.Dr. Riedenschneider (Sam Jaffe) has just been released from prison, and he's got a plan for jewel thievery that he claims can't miss, and it's worth a lotta dough, see? One million bucks that is. (Remember, this is 1950.) A group of men is assembled, including a safecracker, Louis (Anthony Caruso), a getaway driver, Gus (James Whitmore), and a brute, Dix (Sterling Hayden). The plan is to steal the diamonds, then immediately sell them to a man named Emmerich (Louis Calhern), but he intends otherwise. We end up with two men shot and one man dead, with more to come, and police hot on the trail.Perhaps it's that I've seen too many of the heist films that were influenced by this before seeing The Asphalt Jungle. I can see how this film would have been a great, innovative one in its day, but after 55 years, it just seems watered down to me. The characters aren't terribly engaging, and the plot wasn't very complex, but because the characters didn't come across well, it seemed as if it was.With that said, as this is a film noir, I feel the need to discuss its merits on that front. It captures the essence of noir - that people are prone to doing bad things based on greed, sex, and power, and then they are haunted by their vices and get their comeuppance. The cinematography is fantastic, with high contrast black and white schemes and complex frame compositions throughout. There aren't a whole lot of pictures that look like this anymore.

In ""Blackboard Jungle,"" a teacher (Glenn Ford) tangled with savage, inner-city youth. In the CBS-TV thriller series ""The Equalizer,"" an urban security expert allowed his clients to resume life without fear from assailants.Tom Berenger stars as a covert operations specialist on holiday who finds himself back into the classroom to rumble with a drug czar and his killers. The action is as fast and as furious as one of the submachine guns fired in this larger-than-life, but exciting exercise in educational reform. Mandel and ""Street Trash"" scenarist Roy Frumkes, ""Substitute 2"" scribe Rocco Simonelli, and ""Cat People"" writer Alan Ormsby have created an entertaining, suspenseful, sometimes amusing, melodrama with a minor surprise or two. ""Ghost Busters"" star Ernie Hudson registers splendidly as a corrupt high school principal who abuses his authority by allowing sales of narcotics on his premises.An earnest, forthright teacher Jane Hetzko (Diane Venora of ""True Crime"") confronts high-ranking gang-banger Juan Lacas (Marc Anthony of ""Hackers"") during a campus brawl, and he doesn't like the way that she talks to him so he threatens her. Later, as Jane is jogging by herself along the beach, a thuggish Seminole confronts her and cracks one of her knee caps with a bat. Jane's off-again, on-again boyfriend Jonathan Shale (Tom Berenger of the ""Sniper"" movies)tangles briefly with the brute before the brute escapes. Jane lands in the hospital and Shale takes care of her. Shale calls for Jane's usual substitute, but the man isn't available. Instead, Shale gets one of his mercenary buddies, Rem (Luis Guzm&aacute;n of ""Anger Management""), to put him into the school's computer system as James Smith with three diplomas from prestigious Ivy League universities.Shale has the time to devote to Jane's problem, because his men and he have completed a mission that attracted too much international attention and he has to cool it for a while. Meantime, he keeps his surviving commandos in line and out of harm's way. A job to guard drug shipments comes up, but once our virtuous hero learns that he would be killing to ensure the safe passage of narcotics, he turns the job down cold and reprimands his comrade, Joey 6 (Raymond Cruz of ""The Rock"") for setting up the interview.Instead, Shale masquerades as a substitute school teacher when he cannot get an actual substitute for Jane. He assembles his team and tells them that where drugs are concerned, money can be found in large quantities. This serves as their inducement to mobilize their special skills. Along the way, another caring teacher, Mr. Darrell Sherman (Glenn Plummer of ""Saw 2"") gets in the way of the villains, particularly Claude Rolle (Ernie Hudson of ""Ghost Busters"") and pays the ultimate price. The heroes and the villains turn the high school into a battlefield. The villains have stashed a lifetime's worth of cocaine in the school's maintenance garage and Hollan (William Forsythe of ""Once Upon A Time in America"") rigs it up with explosives so when the bad guys go to retrieve it, they are blown up. Not all of the good guys survive this bullet-riddled shoot'em up. Raymond Cruz is quite good and William Forsythe plays another one of his hot-tempered maniacs.

Together, the cold, hard hearts of the Zionists and the Nazis seem to have formed a hammer and anvil upon which the masses of European Jewry were crushed when they would not or could not accede to the demands of this most heinous and grandiose extortion.While the movie only concerns itself with the action of the Third Reich, there is a treacherous implication that they alone were culpable.

It's got a good solid bloodiness, humor both inadvertent and advertent, and an actual cohesive storyline. The other two aren't as good and might only appeal to the serious zombie enthusiast.ZOMBI 3-Directed by Lucio Fulci as a kind of sequel to his hit, Zombi2. A scientist in the Philippines accidently creates a serum that turns people into zombies. It's stolen by terrorists and yadda, yadda, yadda, everyone is turning into zombies. Enter the gun happy military! Highlights include a funky narrative provided by a groovy DJ, zombie birds and a zombie birth! This one is good, honest, zombie-flavored fun.ZOMBIE 4:AFTER DEATH-The zombies in this one are more like zombie/demons and they are raised by a voodoo priest seeking vengeance after his daughter was accidently killed by some scientists who were trying to cure her cancer. 20 years later the only survivor of that zombie/demon attack teams up with some mercenaries to commit horrible acts against the Italian film industry. It's a so-so entry in the zombie movie lists, with some true 80'cheesiness, mediocre gore and acting and production values borrowed from a high-school film class.ZOMBIE 5: KILLING BIRDS-Robert Vaughn (yeah, Napoleon Solo himself) must have really needed plastic surgery money to have taken this job.

Then she looks at the madness around her and despairs, ""But how do I explain THIS!?"",  That's kind of how I feel trying to write a review that does this show justice without handing out major spoilers like candy.  I'll tread lightly, but since the twist becomes fairly obvious early on, I've got some room to work.  While the first 8 episodes of this series languish in every cliche-yet-comfortable anime standard possible, the last disc really starts to elevate the show to a higher level, but then it kind of stalls just as it finally begins to reach the level of it's predecessors, ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" and ""FLCL"".  Too bad; the ambition was there, but in the end this series, while certainly worth a look, just doesn't live up to it's pedigree.The story begins as your standard shy boy meets perfect girl from outer space yarn.  There's love at first sight, a giant monster attack, protagonist Takeru tranforming into a Devilman-esque protector and all that jazz; but we also get the first clue that maybe cute alien girl -dubbed Hikari (meaning ""light"")- isn't what she appears to be.  Then here come Takeru's childhood friend/unrequited love, jealous sex-crazed hangers-on, coy awkward romance, rampant fan service and now we're back in cliche town.  When Hikari's ""sister"" -named Akari (also meaning ""light"")- is discovered by one of Takeru's friends living in the woods, the story deepens some, but also deviates from the characters we were just getting to know for multiple episodes.  Turns out that most of the characters are simply there to be comic relief stereotypes, expositionists, or both so there's not much to explore.  Take Jennifer, an American living in the same apartments as Takeru.  As a scientist, she is often pondering aloud the plot as it unfolds before us, even if you are unaware of it at the time, and when she isn't, she is getting drunk, making lewd comments, and getting naked.  Fun, but boorish.Like I said, the first 2/3 of this show are pretty pedestrian, but as evidence of Hikari's true nature begins to mount, the tension really starts to build.  You will see it coming from a mile away, but I still got goose pimples when the cloyingly sweet anime girl I'd known awakened to her true nature and coldly announced her purpose to shocked friends and family.  This is an ugly world, one where even the best people you know only help others for selfish reasons and are often incapable of loving themselves or, therefore, anyone else.  To obtain a new start, one must discard the old, useless past both physically, psychologically, and evolutionarily.  Hikari is the harbinger of that new beginning.  Brilliant ideas and a whole new awareness sweep through the series  and it's main characters at this point as the world is engulfed in a somehow menacing swarm of crimson butterflies.  This is more than a little bit reminiscent of some of Eva's finest moments, but the brilliance doesn't last long.  The final episodes, while epic, slow down to a crawl and deliver a bittersweet, reflectuive, but somewhat anticlimactic ending that just makes you wish the show had been paced a little better and the ideas presented within explored more completely and expanded upon.""This Ugly Yet Beautiful World"" may not quite live up to it's ambitious title or it's anime forerunners, but it is still a decent little series.  It even has the good sense to poke fun at itself from time to time (referencing ""Please Teacher"" certainly earned some points with me).  For anime newbies, the show is ideal since it's biggest flaw is it's reliance on tried-and-true anime standards that every otaku has seen hundreds of times over.  The characters -one dimensional as they are- are likeable and the climax is quite an impressive spectacle.  As it's title implies there is both good and bad within this series but, like life itself, it is worth the trip if only to see what is around the next bend.  But I wonder if this and other shows' increasing reliance on tried-and-true conventions may signal that the art form has reached it's peak and is about to crash itself.  Is ""This Ugly Yet Beautiful World"" to anime what Hikari-chan is to Earth's lifeforms, a sign that it is time for a change?  Something to think about.My final verdict: three and a half stars rounded down for failed expectations.",3.0,0.9285714285714286,2,1,0.4404,positive,0.9985,very positive,2007,10,20

1306572,B002ZG988M,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,3,9,2010-05-14,Molto Potenziale . . . Risultati Noiosi,"Gary Winick's 2010 film ""Letters to Juliet"" contains all the right ingredients to make a fabulously lighthearted romantic comedy that should teach every lover's torch to burn bright.  However, the overall combination of beautiful young stars, older, dignified stage and film veterans, captivating scenery and Shakespeare's star-crossed lovers does nothing synergistically other than create a rather bland just-under two hour fare.The problem has nothing to do with the storyline; the overall premise here sugars the heart like the perfect icing on a moist cupcake.  Sophie, (the wide-eyed and silken haired Amanda Seyfried--Dear John,Mamma Mia! The Movie (Widescreen)andBig Love: The Complete Seasons 1-3) a wannabe writer, travels to Verona with her fianc&eacute; Vincent (the frenetic Gael Garcia Bernel), a food and wine enthusiast and soon-to-be restaurant owner and chef.  Purveyor opportunities send the passionate Vincent on gourmand fare finding missions that take him away from his beloved and catapult her into Capulet territory--literally showing her another brick in the wall of the Casa di Guilietta.  In this case, the wall wails a bit with letters of the lovelorn from a variety of countries collected each day by a quartet of Italian Dear Abbys that act as Juliet's secretaries, dutifully answering the pleas scribbled from present day petitioners of Shakespeare's most famous maiden.  When Sophie finds an undiscovered note written by Englishwoman Claire bemoaning her decision to leave her lover Lorenzo some fifty years prior, she feels compelled to respond, setting an entire chain of events in motion that may motivate her to write an entertaining feature story but threatens her upcoming nuptials.  Enter stage left, the softly aging Claire (the one and only Vanessa Regrave) appears, prompted by Juliet's long awaited response; she comes to seek her man.  Cynical Charlie (Christopher Egan), the handsome blonde grandson scowls attractively and, of course, cannot help but hate to love the ever-romantic Sophie.  Let me reiterate: As the plot has potential, the golden cypress-speared scenes of the Crete Senesi area of Tuscany lull with their stark photographic beauty and the actors exude sex appeal and enough sad-eyed empathy to play without dialogue, why does this film seem like a wasted 105 minutes?Perhaps `wasted' is too harsh a term. The film attempts to be a pretty confection.  Nonetheless with all these marvelous ingredients, why doesn't ""Letters to Juliet"" play like a modern day Shakespearean sonnet that honors love both old and young?I think the fault lies mainly in this film's editing.  Perhaps to keep the film under two hours, Bill Pankow went digital scissor happy.  Somehow the character of Charlie transferred from the Sophie hating camp to the Sophie loving camp in crucial moments not seen on the screen.  These pre-loving/lusting moments are shown in montage fashion akin to a music video wonder depicting more Tuscan beauty and unheard dialogue between the two leads that the audience needs to hear rather than imagine.  Seyfried pouts and tears up prettily, but as in her performance in Dear John, she doesn't seem to have the range to portray a more mature character.  Egan charms with a Prince Edward polish, yet the dialogue extended to him could have been more developed, less clipped and much more believable if written to enhance his obvious selling points. As a couple, the duo does have chemistry, but the script is hard put to utilize its foundations to the fullest extent.  Not enough scenes providing more emotional disclosure limits both actors.Case in point:  both characters suffer from the loss of mothers--why not a flashback so the audience can absorb the emotional impact of this?  We understand that Sophie and her boyfriend care but do not share a passion for each other's work.  An over abundance of this interplay between Seyfried and Bernal certainly exist.  However, the same scene building is not afforded to the bond between the two eventual lovers.  Unfortunately, Redgrave's role resigns her to little significant dialogue.  As the lovesick grandma, she speaks with her eyes while she searches convincingly for the eyes of her Lorenzo.In such a film, the positive aspects of life are sure to take a warm ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" glow that at times seems more like a travelogue than an adjunct to a scene.  In ""Under the Tuscan Sun (Full Screen Edition)"" Diane Lane and her fellow players exuberantly compliment the loveliness of the scenery and even though there are many moments in Audrey Wells 2003 film that are downright corny and predictable, it somehow works for that particular genre of a film that doubles as two hours worth of tourist marketing.  Who wouldn't want to go Italy and hook up with the likes of Franco Nero, his son and grandson or Raoul Bova? A veritable smorgasbord of men for women of any age.Bottom line?  ""Letters to Juliet"" is meant to display the landscape of Tuscany and the city of Verona in Venito though the golden filter of love both young and old.  Unfortunately, due to a script that eliminates critical bonding between the two lead characters, the film lacks the warmth that one has come to expect from romantic comedy. Predictability doesn't even come into play here.  Everything looks wonderful--both the cast and locales--but a lack of engagement between the audience and the film's characters makes this reviewer wish she had more to smile and laugh about while remembering this film.  Vanessa Redgrave's quiet performance is recommended.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",3.0,0.3333333333333333,1,3,0.0,neutral,0.9993,very positive,2010,5,14

The people who made Airplane and Hot Shots knew exactly what they were going to parody and the audience knew it too.If freaked is a parody I don't have a clue as to what Freaked parodiesFreaked is more of a gaudy conglomeration of the original 1950s Mad Comic Book, The Three Stooges, Dr Cyclops (with freaks instead of tiny people), The Island of Lost Souls, the original Todd Browning movie Freaks and fart humor.On one hand Freaked has no redeeming value - you can't believe the script got a studio green light or that anyone even wrote it for that matter.  Whoever sold the idea for Freaked was very talented salesman!You wonder about the actors - did any of them possibly think this was going help and not hurt their careers.Freaked has so many things that makes a movie bad - it looks cheap and expensive at the same time, it's dumb, stupid and inane. Did I say inane?  Inane does not begin to cover it.  The script is exactly what you would expect from a group of very very immature 8 year boys.  It will numb your brain and make your eyes crossed and by that fact alone Freaked should merit a 1 star rating.But then...on the other hand...the freakn' movie made me laugh...a whole lot...and I kind of liked the idiotic characters and the extraordinary freak makeup the ultra garbage pail kid trading card like creatures and the whole bizarre, ""I can't believe what I'm seeing"" type of the thing.  So I added on some freakn' stars - so like 3 999/1000 stars - but you can't do 999/1000 stars and I'm not going to give Freaked 4 stars...just on principle...I've got my reputation you know.So who is Freaked for?  Id say for no one except the most silly, shallow, near do well, IQ impaired, juvenile minded, Beverly Hillbilly watching, consumer - I don't think I'm one of those...At least I hope not...But  I must admit...I did find the movie to be...rather...er...funny.I admit that you see about 50% of the jokes coming and most of those don't work... but that leaves about 50% that do and that equates to allot of laugh out loud jokes.So - kudos to Randy Quaid who showed true girt and never held back in bringing his ""mad freak maker Elijah"" to life, and to a very good sport and lovely actress Megan Ward as a ""human rights activist"" who solves disputes with Moe Howard violence (I particularly enjoyed this for some strange reason.)  And to every actor who read the freakn' Freaked script, and threw caution (and careers) to the wind and did it anyway - I leave no one out.  And to the good (and odd) folks that were responsible for making me laugh in spite of my better judgment. By the way, that's a freeky feeling in itself.Highlights?

All the actors are fine, they are not great, but they all pulled off a decent performance. I felt David Boreanaz is a miscast though, I like it that he's in the film ('cause I'm a fan, duh) but I truly felt the film is making him living too much in the shadow of Angelus, which he did a brilliant performance in the TV series Angel. I do believe that David can pull off a bad guy who isn't Angelus but as Crash/Satan/death, the sadism is RIGHT THERE, so he's pretty much like Angelus but not as great 'cause there are no brlliant lines that makes your hair stand up like Angelus' linesFor all those people who hate Edward Furlong, can I juss say ?!

Directed by Carl Pierson, the first of three cheap Westerns the long time film editor directed, you need to know right from the start that they did not save the best for last in this series despite the promise of the tagline: &quot;The fight at Robber's Roost...It Teems With Action!&quot;  But Wayne did well enough to move on after this one to Republic Pictures, where eventually he would encounter John Ford, make &quot;Stagecoach,&quot; and become the iconic actor of the American western film genre.Once again John Wayne is playing an undercover good guy, this time named John Wyatt who joins the medicine show of Doc Carter (Earle Hodgins) as a sharpshooter in an effort to find some counterfeiters along the Mexican border in Arizona (It it just me or does counterfeiting sound overly ambitious for the Wild West?  How many opportunities are there to find change for a fake $100, $20 or whatever in these towns?).  Wyatt is suspicious of the Doc but it turns out the bad guy is really Curly Joe Gale (legendary stuntman Yakima Canutt), who is not only the counterfeiter but also found time in his criminal past to frame Curly Joe (it is a decidedly small world in these Westerns).  This is helpful because Wyatt has taken a liking to Doc's daughter, Linda (Marion Burns), billed as Princess Natasha in Wyatt's shooting act.If you have been following the Lone Star series there are really few surprises here in terms of the plot.  If you can frame one person for counterfeiting you can frame another person. The twist on this one is that the Duke's character has to cross the border to pursue Curly Joe and rescue Doc and Linda.  Not surprisingly, our hero has as many problems with law enforcement south of the border as he does on this side.  Then there is the question of why a story about counterfeiting with a canyon in the title ends up having the climax in an old mine.  &quot;Paradise Canyon&quot; also has the diversion of Perry Murdock and Gordon Clifford singing as the Texas Two, but that is not really enough to get this one up to the level of being an average Lone Star oater.  I would not recommend that a John Wayne fan endure all sixteen of these early efforts, but the first dozen or so did have not only the Duke and Canutt but George &quot;Gabby&quot; Hayes, which always helps.",3.0,1.0,10,1,-0.2732,negative,-0.7224,very negative,2004,6,21

In `Step Up"" same thing happens.

Through the events that follow, such as reluctant permission given from Director Gordon (Rachel Griffith), Tyler finds himself attracted to Nora, or vice versa. And this sure-fire boys-meet-girls scenario works better than you expect thanks to the two leads with enough chemistry, natural personalities and dancing talent.Choreographer-turned-director Anne Fletcher successfully combines two different types of dances in the film's concluding part with amazingly beautiful dances, but ""Step Up"" takes too much time to reach there. Unlike Baz Luhrmann's hilarious ""Strictly Ballroom"" many scenes of ""Step Up"" covers the materials such as car theft and street gang, topics that have been used in other films in a better way.

Look, Im no fan of Edward Norton, he's surly, unattractive, and never has any chemistry with his female leads, I suppose maybe they find him as hideous as I do, but I digress.  Honestly, he's not bad in this, Banner is sort of a loner and skin flint, so it works in this role, though again no sparks between he and Tyler.  The Abomination is a great choice as a villian, he's as stong as the Hulk and much more destructive, the Hulk was never as blessed as Spider Man when it came to villian in the Marvel Universe, the Abomination is about as good as he ever got.  I wish he had appeared earlier in the film, we only really get to see him in full form at the end when he tangles with the Hulk.  The million dollar question is..did the CGI Hulk work this time, and in my opinion he did, he looked much more real, though still obviously CGI, but his face was more expressive.  The pace of the film is a bit slow, but not nearly the glacial pace of the Ang Lee film and as it neared the end it really picked up, though ironically I feel the best part of the film was the begining when Banner is chased all over the slums of Rio, yes, it was very ""Jason Bourne"", but all action films crib from Bourne these days.

1019761,B000ICL3QK,A2IG2FG7L85RMU,22,29,2007-02-17,"A ""Cosi"" For Plato's Cave","It's increasingly amusing to see various commentators at this site vying to identify the Mozart production from M22 at Salzburg which best deserves the title of the stupidest and ugliest. My nominee for the prize is Ursel Herrmann's and Karl-Ernst Herrmann's ""Cosi Fan Tutte."" (I don't say Mozart's and Da Ponte's, as the Herrmanns have in this instance made the work singularly their own, and should therefore receive full credit for what they have wrought.)In an interview accompanying the performance, while Mr. Herrmann largely sits meekly by, Ms. Herrmann enlightens us as to the rationale behind this ill-conceived eyesore of a production. She is a wholehearted supporter of the conventional idea that classics are not of a time, but instead ""universal."" What this means to her, unfortunately however, is that as stage director she need not bother to set ""Cosi"" in any specific locale or period at all. She further acknowledges that she'd never before been especially drawn to this masterpiece because it has women too easily deceived. What this encourages her to do is seriously defy the libretto and have the aforesaid women aware of the men's wager which gets the action started. What an original, necessary insight for our time! Da Ponte and Mozart constructed things differently, but what did they know?To sum up, because we have characters still singing in Italian and reflecting 18th century social class but dressed at the same time in much uglier, more modern costumes and treading around among the absurdly minimalist scenery that has become a Eurotrash cliche, this production, far from being universal, is simply and mindlessly not taking place anywhere. Its visually unbecoming oddness calls more attention to itself than any other feature.  Further, and equally far from ""universal,"" this production to the extent it approaches ideas, fosters Ms. Herrmann's bumper-sticker-deep, sadly  dated ""feminism"" along with her unearned cynicism about human ""feelings.""  The most suitable locale for such a procession of stale images and ideas that complacently thinks itself ""cutting edge"" would be, I submit, the wall of Plato's cave, with the audience the bound prisoners and the Herrmanns the manipulators of the pantomimes projected on it. ""Universal,"" in short, to the Herrmanns means apparently their directorial freedom to engage in the unwitting promotion of contemporary cliches in sets, costumes, and vision.The Herrmanns agree further that fussy stage business is necessary at every moment. If clashing swords interfere with chords in the overture, for example, it makes no difference. Who after all still goes to the opera to hear the music?  The audience was probably assumed by the Herrmanns to be made up instead of hyperactive types or people forced in the workplace to ""multitask."" If its members had to hear only miraculous music, glorious singing, and satiric wit, they might get bored.Not only must the audience be bombarded, then, with excessive stage ""business,"" but even some of the orchestra members have to be irrationally brought into the action, for fear that they too, by just playing their instruments, might begin to feel hopelessly non-interactive.The saving graces of this production are in the areas where the Herrmanns would have had the most trouble interfering. The music is beautifully played and finely conducted. Despite the seeming effort to dress and make up the characters in as unattractive a manner as possible, everyone is in good to fine voice. These last features alone are what have garnered the stars in this review.",3.0,0.7586206896551724,1,1,0.0,neutral,0.8618,very positive,2007,2,17

In this movie he played a wimp, a henpecked nebbish, who snapped.There are a few turnarounds to look for.  The most obvious one is the moment when he snaps, when he changes from an abused wimp into a man who won't take any more abuse.  The change doesn't fit him though, leading him to act out of character and do something he lives to regret.An almost comedic turnaround happens when we meet his wife's previous husband.  The shrewish and demanding wife always used that husband as a weapon to make poor Edward feel inferior, but when the prior husband suddenly appears in the flesh, not dead after all, he doesn't live up to his press clippings.A striking turnaround occurs, in more ways than one, when Edward rescues a damsel in distress from a thief on the street who is pushing her around, only to find out later that his damsel in distress is in love with her attacker and thoroughly enjoys the distress he puts her through.This femme fatale illustrates that many women feel sexual chemistry with confident, cocky men, not with nice, attentive guys who are eager to please.  It's actually course 101 in how to pick up a girl, minus the slapping.In fact, next time you think of buying a book to teach you how to win the interest of a new girl, don't buy the book, just watch Scarlett Street.  Do what the villain does, and avoid doing or saying anything that Edward G Robinson says and does.  Be cocky and brash, self centered and demanding, and you have just improved your odds.Girls may like wimps as friends, but being too attentive too soon makes you look needy and desperate, and places you in the ""friend"" category right off the bat.  Make her think she has to do her best to impress you, not the other way around.  Watch Dan Duryea giving a lesson in how to make girls fall for you.  Now you know why all the pretty girls went with gorillas in high school and ignored you.The ending is a Hollywood ending.  The human conscience is more punishing than the law could ever be.  Somehow I doubt that.  I can't picture Saddam Hussein tormented about all the poor Kurds he hurt.  But this is Hollywood, not Iraq.I could have accepted Robinson's torment as being unique to himself and therefore believable, but it is set up by someone's comment that this degree of remorse is to be expected.  Baloney.Other reviews on this site indicate that the film was forced into showing all the remorse because it was necessary to punish Robinson for his crime, without sending him to prison.  I believe it.  I believe that the moviemakers felt compelled to do that.It explains but doesn't excuse the unreality of the ending.  I could only buy that degree of remorse if they had set it up for me, as a very special case unique to this one character.

After the disappointing result from Breaking Point, this match actually delivered here as Taker tried to use his power & even attacking Punk various times with the Cell itself. Punk was able to use his speed & quickness to the point where he heavily focused on Taker's leg that ended up becoming a factor at times in the match with weapons like a steel chair & even the ring steps getting used as well. If you can take under consideration that this match was short due to Taker's condition at this point in his career, this was my favorite Cell match of the night as both men put on a good performance with the crowd heavily into the action.Intercontinental Champion John Morrison vs Dolph Ziggler. The continuation of the WWE pushing the Intercontinental Championship to where it belongs as these two hard workers had a very athletic contest with the action being fast paced at times as Ziggler just keeps impressing each & everytime I have seen him while I already know how great of a performer Morrison is. It's not a classic like the Mysterio/Jericho series earlier in the year but a very enjoyable encounter.Divas Champion Mickie James vs Alicia Fox. The only part that got my attention during this match was the sick DDT that Mickie delivered at the end as this match was very dull & boring for me.Unified Tag Team Champions Chris Jericho & Big Show vs Batista & Rey Mysterio. Once again, I'll admit that I am no fan of the Jeri-Show tag team but each time I have seen them on PPV, they deliver & this was no exception. A very good tag team match as it seemed that all four men just stepped their game up for this match with Batista & Show meshing well with their power offense while we already know what to expect when Jericho works with Mysterio based of their series earlier in the year. I would rank this as the best match I have seen from the Jericho/Show tag team so far.Hell In A Cell: WWE Champion John Cena vs Randy Orton. Just like their Breaking Point match, this was more of pushing the storyline & characters than putting on a good match while at the same time, this match came off more as a No Disqualification match than being a Cell match as this match had a slow pace with both men trying to play mind games with the other along with Orton doing his usual but great ""Viper"" attack even using a chair at one point or another. This would have been better as a No DQ match but I'll give it credit as this did tell a good story but overall, I thought it was a weak Cell match.R-Truth vs Drew McIntyre. This was one of those matches that was placed on the wrong spot as if it was the opener, the crowd would have enjoyed it more as this was just a decent match but the crowd was really not into it as they chanted ""Boring"" during it.United States Champion Kofi Kingston vs The Miz vs Jack Swagger. Just like the previous match, this match was at the wrong place at the wrong time. A good match for what it was but it was nothing really memorable which was a shame considering the surprise match that Kofi & Miz had the previous month.Hell In A Cell: D-Generation X vs Legacy. Unlike how their SummerSlam & Breaking Point matches turned out, this was easily my least favorite out of their matches because I just found this match to be very predictable from start to finish. The beginning starts as a brawl between all four men before Cody & Dibiase tried to use the same tactics that payed off to them at Breaking Point by taking out Triple H & locking Shawn in the Cell to be tortured before Triple H was able to eventually get in the Cell to turn the tables on Legacy. Their previous matches had both teams exchange wins but everyone came off strong in the end where this match was more about showcasing Triple H's dominance than anything else. I know I am in the minority but I am just being honest in that I really didn't care for this match at all.Overall, as I mentioned in the beginning of my review, this event was similar to Breaking Point in which a one time use of the concept will work (ex. DX/Legacy at Breaking Point & Taker/Punk here) but you can't get away with creating three of them & having every single one come off as a success. The undercard had some good matches here & there but this is really just another event that is good for a rental or WWE Classics On Demand but I would go out of my way to buy this.",3.0,1.0,3,1,-0.6808,very negative,0.9985,very positive,2010,1,17

I may not keep the collection long enough to watch The Chinese Ring.To be honest, I do not remember any of the plots.Because some read reviews for information on the technical quality of the presentation: These disks played well on my DVD player. Video was relatively clean and I noted no major problems in the audio. For 60 odd year old black and white, these may be better than average transfers. TCM handled them well.The biggest problem may just be timing. These movies were made in the middle 40's, things moved slower. In fact the car chase in The Trap, allegedly at 75 MPH was over a narrow poorly surfaced road and was comic, if not intentionally.Sidney Toller, not the definitive Charlie Chan, comes across as tired and old.

If you are a horror fan, you will notice alot of familer scenes and styles that the director adapted for the great look of this film. The film starts out fast and slows down halfway through. The first 45 minutes we are witnessing multiple gruesome murders at breakneck speed then the film slows down and follows the lead character Nami. At this point, the film uses fear and style to keep the movie rolling. Some scenes will almost seem like rip-offs such as fast moving perspective shots (a la Evil Dead) and a scene with maggots falling from a ceiling (Suspiria) but I think these scenes are done out of tribute and respect before plagerism. I did enjoy this movie and I do recommend it to serious horror fans but I did dislike the ending. Others may like the ending and it sort of reminds me of Dario Argento's style of twisting the story out of control at the last minute but here it is just a gooey way of bringing a final shock. Some of the violence in this movie is a little over the top for me too but that is a personal preference. I usually have a high tolerance towards gore but I had a hard time watching the first murder on the videotape sent to Nami. I also wasn't fond of the scene where Rya gets raped and then drug over the top of the car and dropped on her neck/head.

It was to have been shot on location in Ceylon starring the iconic Vivien Leigh. She, Peter Finch (as her husband), and Dana Andrews (as his foreman) were dispatched to what is now Sri Lanka. Shooting had begun when the bi-polar Leigh sadly suffered another episode and what was to be a prestige production shut down. But the footage in the can was too good to waste, forget the money already spent, and Paramount resumed the film in Hollywood as an adult vehicle for the lovely young Elizabeth Taylor.The result, regrettably, is what you'll see on this new DVD.Leigh can be seen in many long and medium shots. She, Finch and Andrews appear in actual exotic locations, and some of those scenes are intact, such as the tea harvesting, a show of costumed dancers, and masses of elephants stampeding about. These sun-lit locations are in stark contrast to the studio-lit settings into which they have been edited. We see Leigh arriving at a jungle mansion, strolling onto a veranda and sitting down to tea, a mountain landscape behind her, only to cut to Taylor on a set with that landscape seen on a screen. It is tantalizing to wonder what kind of classy melodrama this might have been had Leigh not suffered a breakdown.It's also very easy to mourn that non-movie while watching this one. Taylor is beautiful in Edith Head gowns and lavish interiors, but she is not yet the actress of ""A Place in the Sun"" or ""Virginia Woolf"" (one scene, in which men ignore her after dinner, is repeated later in ""Giant."") Taylor is only as responsive as her director, and she's had some fine ones. Finch (Leigh's lover then) and Andrews (too old opposite Taylor) try hard, but the script and leading lady were not in their league. ""Elephant Walk,"" patched together as it is, is still an interesting curio, pretty to behold, and perhaps that's how it should be remembered.

She is sent to what should be the most stress-free post there is for the U.S. Marshall's;  Antartica.  As the only law enforcement presence on the continent, Carrie is kind of like a sheriff in a western.  Of course, Antartica is quite a bit bigger (and way more hostile!) than a town in the old west.Unexpectely, Carrie chances across some ""action"" as the corpse of a murdered man is found out in the middle of the wastelands.  It's up to Carrie to find the murderer, and her investigation untangles an elaborate scheme to smuggle the cargo of a forgotten transport plane out of the country.One of the most remarkable features of the film (aside from Kate, anyway), is the cinematography.  The filmmakers do a good job of making the austere landscape of Antartica into a bona-fide character in the story.  Some of the visuals are downright stunning and one momentarily forgets that it's the most inhospitable continent on the planet.Some will notice that nudity is listed as one of the reasons that the film was rated ""R.""  People (like me!) may be curious as to whether Kate is in front of the camera wearing her birthday suit.  The resounding answer is ""NO!""  The movie opens with Kate arriving in Antartica  & stripping down to take a shower, but the camera angles are creative enough so that you don't see anything.  It's a teaser scene that seems to have been thrown in there just to egg-on the viewers who are wondering what sort of ""nudity"" is in the film.

But that is not necessarily a reason for panic, or even for pessimism.  Nor is it a reason to define the suburban lifestyle ""experiment"" as a failure.The documentary assumes that American's are so rigidly wedded to the suburban model that we can not adjust to a new one.  Life through the ages has always been fluid, and anyone familiar with American history can see that the nation and its culture have had to frequently readjust to a new reality after a certain lifestyle has finsihed its course.  The closing of the frontier in the 1890's and with it the easy acces to free or cheap farmland was supposed to mark the end of American dynamism and and growth, but Americans responded by turning their energies to developing a new lifestyle centered on the town and city.  50 years later, new problems (Depression and war) and new technologies (automobiles) brought about an new lifestyle in which the small towns and urban centers dwindled and suffered while the suburbs boomed.The suburban lifestyle should not be judged a failure simply because it's time is starting to pass.  It was in fact a very successful living arrangement while it lasted.Now that it is nearing the end of its usefullness, there is no reason to believe that society will not adapt to the new realities.  As people may choose to live in places where they can easily walk or ride public transport to transact their daily businesses, we could end up seeing a new revitalization of  small town America's main streets as well as the larger city centers.  Big sprawling strip malls may be replaced once again with mom and pop corner stores in the cities, and main street shops in the small towns.In short, suburbia was fun while it lasted, but what comes after it may be better.

18152,0767825489,A36W5RAALXS1CS,3,3,2010-07-14,"Drat, It's Ghidorah Again!","GODZILLA VS. KING GHIDORAHBack in 1991, Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah created something of a stir on this side of the water because there were rumblings that the film had distinct anti-American overtones. However, it would be several years before it received a domestic release (which was straight to video), and overall, the American audience found the fuss to be much ado about nothing.For fans, the far bigger deal about Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah was Ghidorah's new origin and the convoluted storyline, which took the theme of time travel to new heights of ridiculousness. No longer an awesome, planet-destroying monster from space, Ghidorah is now the product of a weird combination of time travel, small critters, and radioactivity. The story goes like this: a time-traveling flying saucer lands in Japan in 1992, bringing with it an international crew from the year 2204. They claim that, in their age, Godzilla is running rampant and must be destroyed. They have discovered that Godzilla was birthed on a Pacific Island called Lagos during the U.S. nuclear experiments of 1945, so their plan is to go back to that time and move the dinosaur that will eventually become Godzilla to a new location. They succeed in doing this; however, they leave behind some cute little critters called dorats, or drats, which have features that suspiciously resemble King Ghidorah. And in the 20th century, Godzilla is gone from history (even though everyone somehow remembers him), and King Ghidorah has replaced him. Shock of shocks! The future people have planned all along not to save Japan but destroy it, thus preventing it becoming the dominant economic and political world power.However, in the 20th Century, radioactivity apparently exists in profusion in every corner of the world, and in the Toho universe, radiation plus critter equals daikaiju. So the dinosaur is once again transformed into Godzilla, even bigger and more powerful than before. Godzilla and Ghidorah battle, and Godzilla prevails, casting Ghidorah's body--now minus one head--into the ocean. As Godzilla begins a devastating attack on Japan, future person Emi, who disapproves of her people's motivations, returns to the future, has the dormant Ghidorah reconstructed as a cyborg, and then returns it to the 20th Century to do battle with Godzilla. This time, Mecha Ghidorah whoops on Godzilla sufficiently to send him into the ocean, but in the process the cyborg is terminally damaged and sinks into the ocean as well.With rare exception, I've never cared much for time travel stories, and after the relatively dark, disaster-themed scope of Return of Godzilla and the nightmarish topicality of Godzilla vs. Biollante, the fantastical excesses of Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah come off as outright silly--particularly its half-baked time-travel aspect. Beyond that, the alteration of King Ghidorah's origin--making it, in essence, a Godzilla changeling--serves to void the metaphorical power of the original Godzilla story; in essence, diminishing Godzilla himself. As a powerful alien entity from the stars, King Ghidorah worked. As the mere tool of an advanced but decadent future civilization, a deliberate product of technology, it falls flat on its face.On the flip side, despite its very serious dramatic shortcomings, the pacing of the film is among the best of the Heisei series. The cinematography is colorful and well composed, and Akira Ifukube's powerful score, which reprises the original Ghidorah theme, is beautifully orchestrated. The Godzilla suit, only slightly modified from its design in Godzilla vs. Biollante, appears very impressive. Surprisingly, despite a Western cast with the acting ability of elementary schoolchildren, the backstory of the ""Godzillasaurus"" on Lagos Island plays out remarkably well. Yoshio Tsuchiya, portraying loyal-Imperial-Japanese-soldier-cum-industrial-magnate Shindo, turns in a superlative performance, and with Ifukube's score providing a poignant backdrop for his character, almost single-handedly elevates the movie to respectable status.Whatever its failings, and they are many, Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah does succeed at being an entertaining movie, and when it comes to portraying Godzilla as a truly powerful, virtually unstoppable force of nature, it hardly gets any better.GODZILLA AGAINST MOTHRAThe Heisei-era Godzilla films (1984-1995) began on a promising note, with Return of Godzilla (a.k.a. Godzilla 1985), which--though flawed--unfolded as much like a contemporary disaster film as a monster story. The following film, Godzilla vs. Biollante, was equally flawed, but it ventured into some new territory for the series; featured a redesigned, fierce-looking Godzilla; and brought the suitmation technique for endowing monsters with life to a more sophisticated level. Then...Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah happened, which might have been a spectacular visual treat, but was a holy horror in the plotting/internal logic department. The film was a box-office success, however, and Toho rushed the following film, Godzilla Against Mothra, right into production.While the Heisei films generally maintained consistent continuity, the plot mostly ignores the events of Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah, for which one may well be thankful; however, the story rates among the most didactic of the Godzilla films, with an environmental theme so overbearing that even if you buy the message you wouldn't be averse to clocking the messenger. From its opening moments (an overt homage to Raiders of the Lost Ark), the film feels derivative, with much of its storyline lifted from 1961's Mothra and 1964's Mothra vs. Godzilla. Numerous catastrophic environmental disasters wrack the earth simultaneously, from typhoons to volcanoes to landslides due to over-development. In response to the ecological damage, Mothra and its darker sibling, Battra, are awakened--the latter with the aim to put things right on Earth by force. The more gentle Mothra opposes Battra, but its caretakers--the ten-inch tall fairies (now known as the Cosmos)--are kidnapped by the profiteering Mr. Tomokane of the land-grabbing Marutomo Corporation, and Mothra turns its ire on Japan in attempt to rescue them. In the meantime, Godzilla is not particularly happy with either monster, and comes around periodically to tangle with them--until, in the end, they team up and do a little whooping of their own.The two main characters--rogue archaeologist Takuya Fujita (Tetsuya Bessho) and Masako Tezuka (Satomi Kobayashi)--provide slightly more engaging personalities than some of the other Godzilla films of the era; they are divorced and not amiably so. Some of the acrimonious interplay between them is convincing if not always appealing. Takehiro Murata, as Marutomo representative Kenji Andoh plays a corporate beanpod who almost has a conscience well enough, and even provides a touch of comic relief now and again. The greedy head of the Marutomo Corporation, played by Makoto Otake, is an amalgamation of notorious exploiters Clark Nelson from the original Mothra and Jiro Torahata from Mothra vs. Godzilla, but Otake's performance tends to be a bit over the top and devoid of any depth. Unfortunately, most of the rest of the cast stands around and offers nothing to the story, especially Heisei series regular Megumi Odaka as psychic Miki Saegusa, whose appearance in this film is solely to look worried.While some of the special effects work may be impressive, the Mothra and Battra designs and execution are anything but. Mothra, in both larva and imago form, never appeared so artificial; despite the advances in SPFX technology in the intervening years, the Showa-era Mothra in all its various incarnations appeared more convincing, especially in the original 1961 film under the supervision of effects director Eiji Tsuburaya. Battra is a suitably evil-looking creature, but the puppet could hardly be less animated, and in many scenes its supporting wires are clearly visible.During his tenure as special effects director, Koichi Kawakita had a tendency to overdo the optical effects, with an abundance of fiery rays constantly crossing the screen, sparkling flashes erupting over the landscape, and brilliant halos surrounding the monsters. In Godzilla Against Mothra, there's scarcely a scene with the monsters that isn't optically enhanced, and though the light show occasionally highlights the raw power of the monsters' deadly exchanges, for the most part, it simply distracts.Unquestionably, the movie's single most effective feature is Akira Ifukube's musical score. While most of the themes are familiar, especially the Mothra motif used in the original Mothra vs. Godzilla (based on Yuji Koseki's score for the original 1961 Mothra), the richness and variations of the orchestrations add a poignancy the soundtrack, particularly the ending theme as Mothra flies into outer space to intercept and destroy a meteor on a catastrophic collision course with Earth.Overall, Godzilla Against Mothra doesn't hold a candle to the Showa-era Mothra vs. Godzilla, to which it must inevitably compare, and at the time of its release, I would have called it the least entertaining of the Heisei-era Godzilla films, for despite its inane plot, at least Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah offered something unique. Unfortunately, there would be at least one other entry in the Heisei series to make Godzilla Against Mothra look like a classic....",3.0,1.0,1,2,0.0,neutral,0.9982,very positive,2010,7,14

Well, he used to be anyway since, aside from Cast Away, he seemed more focused on advancing the technology but not really worrying if the story's badly written, sluggish or just not emotionally involving. Case in point: The Polar Express, which was a beautiful looking film which suffered from zombie-looking eyes and stiff movements. Beowulf is at least more story-centered but it's still not as involving, even with all the flash and pop.A creature named Grendel has been terrorizing a village and small kingdom and they ask for a hero to come and slay the monster. In comes Beowulf, a legendary hero who's not humble and noble but almost overconfident. With the King wanting the creature dead and the Queen showing affection for Beowulf, he must slay any demons that come his way and possibly deal with his own.The process used to make Beowulf is a more advanced version of ""motion capture"" which essentially puts actors in a suit filled with small balls that many cameras read and scan into computer and make a digital model of you so whatever you do, your digital you does as well. That gives CG animators freedom to have whatever kind of character model, whether creature, strong, alien over the performance you give. But after the Polar Express, the aim was more photorealistic but met with criticisms such as rather soulless-looking eyes and stiff movements, particularly in the face.Beowulf has even more advanced detail and realism but there's still something...""off"" about it, like you can just tell it's not right. Either they just wanted a different look to live action or duplicate it I don't know but it's hard to completely immerse yourself into the film since you're constantly going ""that looks like Angelina Jolie but....not"". Then again, the story's not really involving and doesn't really have a narrative drive to it with the climax just happening without much buildup (it's not just a problem with men but apparently movies about heroes as well I guess). Gone are the days of Back to the Future and Roger Rabbit where the visuals helped support the narrative; now it seems like it doesn't matter what narrative it is as long as it gives them a chance to use the visuals.I'd recommend seeing Beowulf mainly for the visuals alone, especially if you have an HD-equipped television and you can go up to 1080i or even the HD-DVD version.

In returning to the Orpheus myth three times over a thirty year span, Cocteau displayed an ongoing fascination with the artist as a chosen creature, attuned to a special realm of beauty that eludes the common run of humankind. To my mind though, these films are more concerned with revering the Poet than with being poetic. The special effects they rely on to convey the world on the other side of the mirror, the artist's domain of wonder and dreams, are awkward even for their time and struck me more as stagecraft than a real engagement with the subconscious as a creative force. Outside of the imagery, the films have little to offer in the way of narrative or acting or cinematographic wizardry. For surrealist filmmaking, Buster Keaton has Cocteau beat hands down.Watching these films it occurred to me--and I'm sure I'll get a lot of negative votes for this!--that Cocteau was at heart a poseur. He recognized the genius in his famous friends and collaborators (Picasso, Stravinsky, Satie, Apollinaire) but when it came to expressing his own, relied on a canny restatement of the Romantic idea of the suffering artist, one that would play well to the public but had little to do with the radical new art burgeoning around him.

1683192,B00H1RMOI6,A2RYXCJ91AQPS9,1,2,2014-07-07,Brainless entertainment and that's about it,"There were always those action stars, who you watched countlessly during the 80's as they pumped out actioner after actioner. And you know just as much as I did, that you fantasized about the possibilities of having those two actors in the same film. But it was just a fantasy, a dream that wouldn't reach reality until more than 30 years later with the release of 'Escape Plan'. Generic title aside, the film features the epic mash up of our Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) and our Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) as two old dudes trying to escape from prison. I must say, I had a great time with this brainless popcorn film, but might as well share what I felt about the film, besides the entertainment level. My review of 'Escape Plan' below.'Escape Plan' follows Ray Breslin (Played by Sylvester Stallone) whose profession is literally escaping from prisons. He walks in disguised as a convict and eventually breaks out. His job is to test prisons to make sure they are escape proof. And finally he meets his match, accepting anew prison named The Tomb, Breslin walks in just as he usually would but in this case, he isn't meant to be allowed out. Aided by fellow prisoner, Emil Rottmayer (Played by Arnold Schwarzenegger), Breslin attempts to escape The Tomb.Yes, I'll admit it's an interesting idea, but once you watch the movie, that idea unfolds rather predictably. It's just the fact that the plot doesn't have enough meat to make it tough to break through. It's basically one layered. Once you finally pick off that layer, you reach the bone, and once you reach the bone, you're basically done. The plot is, because by then you know what's going to unfold to the end. The plot isn't anything you haven't already viewed before in countless other brainless action flicks. It's too lazy, too predictable. It plays out just how you would expect, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it's far from being good. Nothing you see makes you say 'Wow, now that's something I've never seen before'.The dialogue is somewhat lazy and very much expected in this type of film. You have three main action movie dialogue. First up are the cheesy one liners, which were ushered out of the mouths of both Schwarzenegger and Stallone. Next you have the grunts and moans, which passed out the mouths of many characters. And lastly you have the vast shouts of foul language that is the seal of action film approval. Nothing here is more than average dialogue; nothing is said that stimulates your thought train.But I must admit we have two talented leads that ride this tale along with ease, as they are in facts veterans of the genre itself, you could even call the two, two of the founding fathers of the genre. I refuse to praise one over the other, clearly there is a more prominent one of the two throughout the film, taking the possessive lead role, but both hold their own, and in t he end tie for the lead awards. Schwarzenegger and Stallone work well together, they play off each other. Both have great chemistry with the other, and when they meet on screen for the first time, ever, the room goes silent. A small smirk appears across your face at that moment, victory, at last dreams have come true. Schwarzenegger coming off a so-so return to the genre in 'The Last Stand' redeems himself in this film, and Stallone still convinces the audience that no matter his Weighing age, he still has what it takes to lead an action film, convincingly. As for the supporting cast, 'Jim Caviezal' comes to mind. In the recent years, Caviezal has reduced his bigger budgeted film appearances in favor of more independent film work. In his return to the big-budget genre, Caviezal plays the sinister, villainous Warden of The Tomb. Every scene he was in, he stole the show. He held his own to the more experienced leads, who were much more acquainted with the genre then he was himself, and he ends up played a formidable foe to Schwarzenegger and Stallone. While I wished he had more screentime then he was given, he manages to make the most of his time, and till his end, he was the most interesting of the lot, both his performance and his character.Speaking of characters, we don't have many unique ones in this lot. Back stories would have been taken kindly, if only there were any. Only one do we receive and that is for Stallone's character. Now, I must admit the character's back-story is heart wrenching and somewhat emotional, but not very much surprising, once you get to know him. Still never the less, he is one of the few characters that isn't just there to be there. The other interesting character is the film's own villain. He is sophisticated, clever, mean, crazy, and calm. He is everything at once; it's a lot to take in, in the few minutes he has per scene he's in. But man, do you solute him off with awe. A spotlighted character in a sea of unmentionables.The sets were pretty marveling. The prison itself was pretty amazing, the cells, and the reckroom. The prison just was perfectly designed from head to toe. The clear glass cells were pretty well set up, and seemed to go on endlessly. They glowed in the darkened area. The different rooms came out looking like a real prison, just more high tec. It was just amazing and how precise the designers were.What makes an action movie, an action movie is of course the action itself. And when you get to the bottom of it, there is plenty of action, more towards the climax but still there is action. And I must admit it was pretty well choreographed. In the shot that watches over the prisoners as they fight the guards toward the end really comes to mind. That action shot looked to include roughly 33 prisoners and 200 guards. And with smoke blaring, and guns firing and men hollering, you need to make sure it comes out just right. And with relief they do succeed in doing just that. You get perfectly quick and practiced punching and fighting and I just loved every moment of it.The editing is so-so. At times it comes out roughly, which at the most part occurs during Stallone's quick plummet into a pile of water after discovering where he was. And sometimes there is a glitch during fight scenes, some shots of the cells weren't angled perfectly but overall it comes out fine.I must spend a moment to praise the entertainment level the film had. Not during one moment did I stop, and yawn. I was wide awake and chewing down on my supply of popcorn. That's what the film is, a popcorn film. Brainless, as it was, it was still very entertaining. And to the common moviegoer that's exactly what they want. Something that distracts their minds from the stress of reality, and the film does just that. It entertains you, and leaves you happy in the end. So that only makes it hard to hate the film.All and all, 'Escape Plan' serves you what you want, brainless entertainment, and with that sacrifices an excellent cast, with an uninspiring story and characters you'll end up forgetting in the end.

The narrator/writer attempted to give people a contrast of the Inner Harbor tourist area with the projects, however during this era that Inner Harbor area didn't exist. Camden Yards didn't exist. This was an 80's development.The film is certainly inspirational to handicapped children who aspire to be drug dealers.

This was only the first plot twist that fractured my concept of suspended reality in this flick.To put it more directly, I could not believe much of what was occurring on screen in this film. I enjoyed the movie and agree it is a good thriller, but I cannot lend much credibility to the overall film. I'd like to say this movie is a great work of art, but it isn't. It has many very entertaining moments but its weaknesses outnumber its strengths, in my opinion. The end product is it is not a very memorable film, although it could have been with more appropriate casting and direction.There were too many coincidences, too many plot twists that could never occur in real life, and too many miscast characters, the first being Washington's wife that was a police investigator but looked and dressed like she was a model throughout the film. Her lipstick and eyebrows were so beautiful and so artistically done that...well, I couldn't believe she was a cop. She exhibited about as much police acumen and investigative imagination as a supermodel, too. This was a ridiculous piece of casting done obviously to show off a beautiful person.The Amazon review said this movie was, ""Partly inspired by 1948's 'The Big Clock' and its nominal 1987 remake 'No Way Out', the Denzel Washington thriller Out of Time is quite enjoyable if you ignore its implausible plotting."" That is very generous praise, indeed. I see a relationship between Kevin Costner's remake of ""No Way Out"" and this film but none between the classic ""The Big Clock"" with Ray Milland.If you order those films in terms of their place in Hollywood legend, ""The Big Clock"" is up among the top 200, ""No Way Out"" is among the bottom half of the film's of its decade and this movie is even lower than that.

Quotability is a must for attaining cult status consideration.4) Monster Aesthetics: Grendal is an acceptable adversary for Beowulf, but his demoness Mother (Layla Roberts) is even better.5) Music Appreciation: 'Beowulf' contains a strong, pounding, contemporary rock soundtrack to help keep you focused.OK for one viewing, but not much more unless you're a hardcore Lambert fan or just like looking at Rhona Mitra.

Looking through the previous reviews by date, I note that the more thoughtful reviews seem to occur after 9/11, although none of them makes that specific connection.  I, for one, felt mesmerized by the mechanics of the disaster response, and carried along by the implacability of the  lava flow, was reminded briefly of the days glued to the television set in mid-September, 2001.The lava is really the cental character of this film, and the director and special effects people did an excellent job of portraying it.  There are echos here of the final scenes of the original War of the Worlds, when the alien ships march through Los Angeles burning everything in their path.  It is a very effective portrayal of the force of inanimate nature.  The juxtaposition of that brute force with everday urban life is quite effective, and is of course what makes well-done disaster films so mesmerizing.The human characters are trivial by comparison.  Jones and Heche put in competent performances, as do Jacqueline Kim, Gabby Hoffman and Don Cheadle.  I especially enjoyed the repartee between Cheadle and Jones.  They manage to engage our sympathy enough to allow us to relate to them and their situation, but the script is trite and predictable and melodramatic.  The heroism of the police and firemen seemed quite genuine, however, quite in keeping with what we know happened on 9/11.Interestingly, an incipient romantic relationship between Jones and Heche is implied, but never developed, and in fact, unusual for Hollywood in our time, there is no sex in this movie at all.The LA emergency response provides a counterpoint to the lava.  The level of chaos and incompetence portrayed is very high, in contrast to the heroism of the individual characters, which is of course what generates much of the melodrama.The plot isn't terrible, just very shallow and improbable, as one would expect from a film of this type:  Lava erupts in downtown LA, and Jones and Heche figure out how to stop it, with lots of histrionics along the way.  The larger implications of an active volcano appearing in the middle of a major American metropolitan area are not addressed, nor do they belong in a film whose primary intent is light entertainment.  Still, one wonders.  Would the Lakers and Dodgers move elsewhere?While watching this film, I found myself thinking, ""We would do better with something like this now, after 9/11.""Wouldn't we?",3.0,1.0,1,3,0.0,neutral,0.8547,very positive,2005,4,4

The cheesy 80's is written all over it and it's not the mature work of Stephen King, who has come up with scarier material than this. Stars Emilio Estevez as the leader of a group of truck stop diner who have to band together to defeat possessed trucks. A comet that passed through the skies left an eerie green cloud over the town and has made it possible for human's inventions, electronic or otherwise, to rebel against humans. Soon, all the trucks come to life and drive themselves, killing off their drivers. This film is really nothing exciting or even scary. Stephen King has created more frightening horror films. Even if he was trying to go for a science fiction type of horror genre, it did'nt work. Maybe because it was the 80's and this is just one bad apple in the bunch.Yeardley Smith, best known as the voice of Lisa Simpson from The Simpsons is part of the cast. It's refreshing to see her in person and in movies outside from the cartoons. She was also in the short lived early 90's series &quot;Herman's Head&quot;. This is definately not Emilio Estevez's best work. About a year earlier, he had performed in The Breakfast Club in which he did a much better job. He would do the same later in the 90's with the Mighty Ducks movies. The trucks are funny to look at and the humans being killed by them is not as frightening as it should be. Especially comedic is the truck with the Green Goblin head on it. This movie, which is a sort of camp classic, is more enjoyable if it does'tn take itself seriously. This movie DOES try to be serious horror. The ending implies that the survivors made it possible for the aliens in the green cloud to be defeated and it is supposed to be a sort of serious film about survival. But it's not really a good film for that type of plot. I feel this movie would be better to look at in Mystery Science Theatre 3000 where they showcase old camp, bad movies with ad lib jokes. Then maybe this movie would be better to look at. But if you're into the 80's, Stephen King (no matter what he does) and Emilio Estevez, this is the film for you.

But I felt that the formula approach here led to shallow results.  Contrary to many other reviewers, I feel that elements such as lighting, scene sets, editing and cinematography were uninspired and predictable, rather like one would see on a vintage spy television show.  Most of the screenplay was equally dull.  Both of the headline performers did a great job with what they had, although the rest of the performances were cartoonish (probably can blame that on the director).  But the two stars lack chemistry between them.  Of course, in this type of a film, that is a critical flaw.  They seem like they would be much more believable as siblings or old school buddies than true lovers.  I understand that they were supposed to come off as a mismatch, but there is mismatch and then there is just no chemistry.

However, they had a major impact on American culture and it's great that the American Experience series has documented it.Many people have said the hippies of the 1960s became the corporate enthusiasts of the 1980s.  I'd add that they are now the generation that wants to make sure they receive full retirement, pension, and Social Security benefits.  Nothing ""free"" comes to mind now.  Still, this may be a useful work for younger generations to see.Young people had concerns about a war, just like they do now.  This documentary is filled with older, reserved people fearing younger, liberal people; this division exists in the 2000s as well.  If everyone was moving to San Francisco then, in my generation they were moving to Seattle.  If they were worried about the Grateful Dead then, they worried about gangster rap for my generation.  They spoke of LSD then; now the concern is ecstasy.  One exceptional difference is how Woodstock of the 1960s totally had good intentions that Woodstock of the 1990s lacked.I loved how this documentary revealed that not everyone had altruistic motives.  Some college students played hippie, but had no interest in abandoning school.  Some denizens wanted the drugs and could not care less about the ideas.  This work may be fascinating for public health workers and economists just as much as historians.  This documentary stated that hippies themselves didn't want everyone to move to SF for fear that their limited supply of LSD would be depleted.  Having hundreds of runaway teenagers and people living in parks is a health-related and policy-based crisis.As much as challenging racism was brought up, photos and footage of this time and place seemed very homogenous.  Granted, the country was not as racially diverse as it is now.  And also granted, the Black Power movement was departing from the pro-integration stance of the Civil Rights movement.  Still, looking at this documentary, I saw a lot of people speaking about equality with people just like themselves.Willie Brown is noted as having been a state assemblyman, but they never mention he also served as the city's mayor.  Actor Peter Coyote uses a profanity that is, surprisingly, not bleeped out of this public television special.I could also relate as a person who moved to the Bay Area briefly.

I looked forward to seeing this film after all the hype (to say nothing of the Academy Awards), so it was inevitable, I suppose, that I was disappointed.The tension between the rational and the ineffable -- science and religion, reason vs. faith, has always been my favorite literary device.  Think ""Inherit The Wind"", Spencer Tracy version.  The only new insight here is the line ""Someone else introduces us to God when we are young"" (I paraphrase).  I let that sink in.  True enough.This movie reminded me in some ways of ""Cast Away"" -- ship/plane-wrecked at sea and lost on a deserted island.  One man has a Bengal tiger, the other a Wilson soccer ball.  Of the two films, ""Cast Away"" works more cogently for me at illuminating the human condition.  Faith or Fact?  The fork in the road -- the crossroad at the end of ""Cast Away"", and all the choices which preceeded it.  I'm not being dragged into a discussion of whether or not I ""believe in God"", or ""which story I believe"".  Better the mirror held up to see the reflection of a lifetime of choices.The atheist and the person of faith share the same conundrum: neither can speak rationally about the unknowable or metaphysical.  And since no one really knows, we all must wait until our fate meets us.  And therein liveth the fable.ADDENDUM:  I watched this movie a second time in order that I might better connect with the dialogue and narration.  I understand the question (is there a God?), but not the conclusion here: God is in the story.  Life is full of sorrow (polio, shipwrecks, evil people -- which includes the hero here, as he admits in his second version of the story), but also of beauty and joy.  But what we experience as ""real"" depends on how we tell the story?  And that's where we find God?  Too thin for me.  I do appreciate the author and director for tackling this question, however.  That alone makes this a better-than-average film.ADDENDUM #2:  I bought the 3D BluRay, and I must disagree with the people who say the 3D effects are lacking.  This is the best 3D movie I have purchased yet, including ""Avatar"", ""Hugo"", ""Bolt"", and ""John Carter"".  The 3D effects are very good on my Sony 3D BD player and 65"" Vizio 3D HDTV.

The beginning of 28 Days later does not involve any supernatural forces, undead, or infractions of the laws of physical science.  Instead, 28 Days Later is based on the all too believable premise that a secret (government-created?) virus has been released accidentally by some well-intentioned but misguided animal rights activists.  All too believable, except that it seems unlikely that such a ferocious virus would be contained in a room with less security than Nieman-Marcus.When our hero, Jim, awakens from a month-long coma, he finds himself naked and completely alone.  He leaves the hospital, probably assuming he's in a dream, and tries to find someone.. anyone.  What he finds are people infected with the virus, which turns them into zombie-type creatures, and he begins to run.  Luckily, he runs into two of the only unifected people in the city, who just so happen to be perfectly happy to save his life.Then there are a series of bloody encounters with infected people.  All of these scenes are edited in a disoriented fasion, presumably to make the experience more unsettling for the viewer.The group then drives out to Manchester, where they are hoping to find a rumoured vaccine for the infection.  However, what they find is a bizarre military installation.  At this point the movie takes an entirely new tack, and new dangers are presented.  An unlikely series of events leads to Jim rescuing his two partners from the snares of a fascist-leaning army, in the process of which he releases an infected man into the house where the two women are held captive.  Only a film script could find a way to protect these two unarmed women while the rest of the residents of the home perish.The first half of this movie I found incredibly depressing.  If it had been some b-movie popcorn flick, it wouldn't have affected me the same, but the dark tone of this film gets under your skin immediately.

956423,B000CCBCHQ,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,22,26,2006-05-14,"Adios, Brady Bunch","The last season of the Brady Bunch (1973-1974) is either celebrated or maligned by TV viewers. However, the 22-episode season has some genuinely interesting offerings for general and hard-core `Brady' fans alike hidden amongst mediocre offerings.First. Greg's family has to deal with his temporarily inflated ego when a talent agent wants to make `Johnny Bravo' a solo star (""Adios, Johnny Bravo""). What threatens to damage the family however is quickly-if too conveniently-resolved because this is Brady world after all.Then, Bobby gets to deal with ethical issues of his own (""Mail Order Hero""). To bail him out of a fib that he knew Joe Namath, Cindy wrote a `sob story' letter to the football star. Guest-starring as himself in this episode, Namath does not appear mad at the kids-he is instead empathetic.Ms. Popularity herself, Marcia Brady, becomes a working girl this season. To earn some money, she works in the local ice cream parlor (""Marcia Gets Creamed""). Marcia soon discovers a career leaves little time for dating---her once-boyfriend has the nerve to come in with another girl. She then faces another more serious issue when she has to fire her own brother Peter, whom she had recommended for a job at this same parlor. Instead of having an identical work ethic, he had blown off the job.Bobby has a growing experience when the girl he has a crush on tells him she may have the mumps (""Never Too Young""). Like ""Is There A Doctor In The House'"" from the very first season, this episode was really poignant for a generation who did know what having the mumps was like. However, it doesn't translate well to mine-we have grown up with immunization from this same disease.""Kelly's Kids"" actually was a pilot attempt for a spin-off series which never materialized. After seeing how much `fun' Mike and Carol have raising their kids, the childless Kelly's decide they want to become parents too. So, they go down to the local orphanage and adopt Matt (who just happens to be Todd, Milke Lookinland's real-life brother!). However, Matt is lonesome for Dwayne (Billy Attmore) and Steve (Carey Wong) his absolute best friends---who just happen to be black and Asian respectively. Their arrival causes discord in `white bread' suburbia-presumably then still trying to adjust to interracial marriages. Because Sherwood Schwartz often gets maligned for producing too bland sitcoms, seeing where he could have taken a `family' sitcom which did manage to work in an Archie Bunker reference would have been very interesting. It is one of the season's strongest points.Granted Robbie Rist only read the scripts and stage directions which were given to him by other people, but the addition of `Cousin Oliver' was completely unnecessary--and did drag the season down. Oliver is introduced in ""Welcome Aboard'"" as Carol's nephew who temporarily boards with the Bradys while his parents are off somewhere in South America.  Still, Oliver does get one `lead' episode in ""Top Secret"" where he and Bobby are convinced that Mike Brady is working on a project for the FBI-and somehow Sam the Butcher (who has been a LONGTIME family friend!) will steal the project plans for the Russians if he is not stopped.""Snooperstar"" is another episode dealing with a `spy' theme which weakened the season. Fed up with Cindy's prying into her diary, Marcia plants a `story' that a talent scout (Natalie Schafer) is coming to the house looking for the next Shirley Temple. Certain that it will be her, Cindy comes decked out in full regalia, only to later learn that the visitor is really Penelope Fletcher, a client of Mike's who is only making a home visit. The episode is notable for both the famous guest star (Schafer was/is of course still remembered as playing Mrs. `Lovey' Howell on ""Gilligan's Island"" and a transparent suggestion the Bradys certainly can be really vindictive to each other. However, Cindy seems kinda old during this season both for snooping into other people's possessions and wanting to perform `the good ship lollipop'. Susan Olsen herself was embarrassed to have filmed this episode at this point in the series!The series closes with ""The Hair-Brained Scheme"" where Greg's hair turns orange from a mail-order hair tonic which Bobby was selling, right before his high school graduation. The episode has been criticized by both series stars Barry Williams (`Greg Brady') and Robert Reed (`Mike Brady') for the tremendous implausibility of a status-conscious teenager putting an unknown product on his very-prized hair days before a very important event. It's obvious the Brady writers had either ran out of steam or just did not care their series was ending.Especially with this being the last season of this series, there should have been extras-just because this particular show was on its last legs. Whatever uneven script quality this particular season has, the overall series now carries TREMENDOUS cultural significance throughout much of America.

816830,B0001XLVH2,A220FJEQNGMSRN,11,13,2007-12-06,"Half decent, half-atrocious","Gunpowder, Treason and Plot is definitely a mini-series of two halves. The first, presumably based on Jimmy McGovern's unfilmed screenplay Mary Stuart (at one time a big-screen vehicle for Meryl Streep and Glenn Close with Sean Connery producing), is a fairly balanced look at Mary Queen of Scots' troubled reign and the reasons for its failure that's often genuinely impressive, powerfully directed and certainly compelling. While it shows her rather more in command of events than history recalls - here she makes many of her own catastrophic mistakes rather than having them made for her by the shady characters who surrounded her - it does deal convincingly with the problems of a Catholic queen ruling a Protestant country where half her advisors are blinded by their hatred of the English while the other half are in their pay and few have her or Scotland's interests at heart. Unlike previous versions of the tale it acknowledges that a big part of her problem in winning over her subjects was the fact that, having spent most of her life abroad, Mary was more French than Scot and is appropriately played, and rather well, by a French actress, Clem&eacute;nce Po&eacute;sy. She's given strong support by an excellent Kevin McKidd's convincingly loyal and infatuated but brash and disastrously tactless Bothwell, Paul Nichols as her politically expedient but tragically feckless husband Darnley, who loses all interest and charm no sooner has she signed the marriage contract, and Gary Lewis as John Knox, the Ian Paisley of his day.Definitely underfunded in the crowd scenes, which often run to literally a couple of dozen extras, despite the odd misstep - chief among them Mary telling Bosworth to ""Go away to a dark and lonely place and toss your caber, Scottish man"" - it's a fine piece of historical drama that never feels like it's completely sacrificing the history to beef up the drama. Unfortunately everything gained in the first half is completely lost in the dimly related second half, which focuses on the early years of her son James' reign in Scotland and England and the events leading up to the Gunpowder Plot.The Gunpowder Plot is notoriously difficult to dramatise, with much of the historical record distorted into nonsense and myth and both sides rewriting history to suit their purpose as deliverers or martyrs, yet even though the truth probably lies somewhere between the lines there's still a great political thriller to be made about it. This definitely is not it.Unfortunately McGovern abandons all pretence of balance for a piece that plays like a confused rant from an ill-informed and very loud fundamentalist being screamed in your ears, with Robert Carlye's James being turned into an increasingly unbelievable cartoon villain. Indeed, his tendency to revel in his own absolute evil and moral bankruptcy as he colludes in the execution of his mother, gets turned on by gruesome executions and kills his Scottish allies to gain an impoverished English throne makes Shakespeare's Richard III look like Mother Teresa at her most selfless. Aside from the rampant homophobia of the piece (in a rather distasteful moment McGovern implies that the price of James' initial tolerance for Catholics was oral sex from Thomas Percy), it's very dubious history that takes the similarly clumsily characterised plotters at face value with equally broad strokes. In truth it appears that, rather than admit that he had less influence with the King than he claimed, Percy gave English Catholics false hope by exaggerating the support James offered for their loyalty when his ascension to the throne was in doubt to make himself look good, and certainly rather than the plot being uncovered by Emilia Fox's Mata Hari-like hate-fuelled fanatical Protestant spy (who unleashes a rather nasty bout of misogyny in the script when she is raped and strangled by a plotter screaming ""Impotence is power!"") it was undone primarily by their own remarkable clumsiness: when buying gunpowder to kill the King and the entire government, it's never a good idea to do so under your own name. To be fair the script does occasionally acknowledge these own goals, but rarely delves into how incredibly ill-thought out and spectacularly counter-productive the plot was, managing to turn the English public even more against a Catholic faith that had been every bit as ruthless (if not more so) in stifling dissent and persecuting other religions when it was the state religion.At one point the script even conjures up the notion that James widened the plot to rid himself of a troublesome and unsupportive parliament, the King wickedly rewriting history to make the plotters out as cowards so he could start a campaign to conquer Europe (no, seriously) while McGovern's script is guilty of the same thing itself to see `justice' served - at one point he even has Catesby kill Francis Tresham with his bare hands for alerting Lord Monteagle to the plot, despite Tresham outliving him and dying in mysterious circumstances (some historians suspect Tresham was a government agent provocateur and that it was Monteagle who had him poisoned, a much more interesting dramatic angle to pursue). Even the famous moment of historical irony that saw the fugitive plotters blown up by their own damp gunpowder as they attempted to dry it by a fire has been omitted in favor of something much more Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid.None of this would matter so much if it was well written or dramatically convincing, but it's so heavy-handed you half suspect McGovern chiselled the script on stone tablets, all the better to bash the hated Protestant English with. Stylistically the piece is very different to the story of Mary Stuart, abandoning the naturalism of the first half to have characters talk directly to the camera, a device that rarely works and seems more like a quick fix for the poor characterisation than a genuine insight into the characters' mindsets and prejudices. Worse still, the two halves really have no real relation except involving mother and son: the events of the second half are never informed by the first, making you wonder why the two weren't produced as separate standalone dramas. The result is a literally half-decent series, but one you're best advised to stop watching at the halfway point.No extras but a decent widescreen transfer.",3.0,0.8461538461538461,3,1,0.0,neutral,-0.9956,very negative,2007,12,6

The ""wowing"" Japanese urban background, elegant hotel sets and the overall exotic environs surely feel fresh. Together with little presence of American actors (besides of course the male and female leads), they also effortlessly transport the audience to the foreign territory and switch our mindset from one of an, well, audience to that of a tourist.To complete the picture, the movie also lets the audience experience the cultural shocks, but in a rather derisive manner to the Japanese: A doctor who keeps speaking Japanese in a totally vain hope that his politeness would make his American listener understand his diagnosis. Even a translator doesn't have enough mastery of English to get a commercial director's message across to her American client. A prostitute could not even properly say the word ""rip."" On a rare occasion when the movie does not seek to cultural-shock the audience with a language joke, a Japanese teenager is spotted reading a pornographic comic in the public.To be fair, all those depictions are not exaggerated in the movie as they do happen the same way in real-life Japan. But like the exotic photography, the amusement derived from those jokes wears thin. Too thin to warrant their repeated usage in the movie.Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson deliver a great performance. Their characters show their subtle appreciation of each other's company while their mutual feelings are ever closer to the boiling point. Sometimes it seems a mere touch or a lingering stare is what it needs to bring the feelings to the boil.However, the over-reliance on the two actors and the set location renders the movie lacking its core support. This movie is mood-driven, which itself I have no problem with. In order to create the mood, the movie relies on a lot of short scenes. With little story, longer scenes would have plunged the movie into boredom. But also because of little story, the short scenes sometimes feel incoherent and they are linked together only by a weak thread of mood. This thread is weak in this movie because the mood is mainly generated by location-specific factors such as the exotic scenery and foreign faces. But as I have just mentioned, these things wear thin. If you like mood pieces set in Japan, I'd recommend some really good Japanese made TV series in mid 1990's (e.g., Long Vacation).Although I really like the ending scene - touching without sentimentality, the movie in the end feels empty and in a sense, distant. One good thing is the director utilizes very well the location to craft the mood; one bad thing is the location is relied on much too heavily for the good of the film.",3.0,0.0,1,9,0.4277,positive,0.9882,very positive,2004,3,29

That is not limited to this film; if you read the IMDB descriptions of his earlier shorts, there's a lot of this sort of thing going on. (In fact, it would seem to me based on the description that this may be a feature-length reworking of his first short, ""Liberata Me"".) And if you're going to look at this and say ""oh, he's just ripping off 'The Book of Blood' and 'The Hellbound Heart'"", this is not the movie for you. Think of it this way: there are only thirty-six plots. (Absurd reductionists can point to the fact that all thirty-six are outgrowths of the original three: man vs. self, man vs. man, man vs. nature.) Nothing is truly original. Think of this less as rip-off and more as homage.The story: Hagen (&lt;em>The Last Man&lt;/em>'s Santiago Craig) is a little bit of a nutcase. He's obsessed with his dead girlfriend Elizabeth (Zelieann Rivera, who was the second assistant director on that same film), who promised that, if she ever died, she would come back to him. As such, he has kept her around, and tries to stave off putrefaction with regular bathings, keeping the place cold, you know the drill if you've ever tried to store a body, right? In any case, Hagen is approached by Travis (&lt;em>Redemption&lt;/em>'s Chad Grimes), who offers him a deal: Travis knows how to get Hagen into the corridors of Hell, where Elizabeth's soul is held by a demon named Morbius (Teo regular Layton Matthews). What does Travis get out of the deal? Well, he has an autistic brother (&lt;em>Smokin' Aces&lt;/em>' Zach Cumer) who he thinks is suicidal, but who is actually under the influence of a demon of his own, Mr. Skinny (&lt;em>Red 71&lt;/em>'s Nathan Ginn)...I'm only scratching the tip of the iceberg here. There's a lot going on in this flick (and while many synopses have given away a great deal more about the plot, including who Morbius is and how Hagen and Travis are related behind the scenes, I'll let you find those things out for yourself), and if you're not paying attention throughout, you're probably going to lose your way. In fact, that's pretty much a given if you miss details of certain key scenes. Make sure you have a big enough drink stash by the easy chair before you start the movie. Getting up and going to the kitchen will have you scratching your head and saying ""what the hell?"" when you get back. A lot of people think that ruins a movie, it seems, judging by a number of comments I've read about this flick. Me, I consider it a strength; a lot of thought went into the script here, and Teo and co-writer Stephanie Joyce did as much to keep all the threads tangled as they possibly could. But if you think about the film, they all make sense.While I'm certainly not going to place &lt;em>Necromentia&lt;/em> on the level of classics like &lt;em>Hellraiser&lt;/em> or &lt;em>The Evil Dead&lt;/em> on a technical level, as far as the story and its presentation go, I think Pearry Teo is a visionary with a great deal to say about life and what follows it. He may not have been as clear as is necessary to gain the movie the wide cult audience it richly deserves, but I'm hoping that as time goes on, word of mouth will get more and more people watching this surprisingly good film. If you've got the mental capacity to grasp the complexities of, for example, the cult Japanese comedy &lt;em>EGG.&lt;/em> and the attention span to keep a few critical details in mind as the film progresses, this is well worth your time if you're a horror fan. ** ",3.0,0.0,12,1,0.4215,positive,0.9942,very positive,2011,12,29

This A-story or B-story is suggested to provide a certain cohesive tension until graduation night when this event is supposed to commence, but does not.  The school (junior high?) it seems is divided between cliques of vampires and werewolves, excepting the class valedictorian and the faculty, losers who retain their humanity, even in Hollywood. One sits around the school cafeteria with one's respective intimates, vamp or wolf, rapping, and staring down at the crummy institutional fare on the plate, inwardly craving a gut full of good ol' flesh and blood.  Not an unrealistic portrait of school life when honestly considered.  Shakespeare would seriously envy the amount of dialogue packed into this script which deluges the audience in backstory, mercilessly playing on the deepest hopes, fears, and dilemmas of folks between the ages of eight to maybe fifteen, until they either swim or drown. But none can doubt the commercial success of Twilight. The makers have targeted their audience (the bulk of the current theatre-going audience alluded to above) with enviable expertise. Surprisingly, action scenes account for no more than 15% of the footage, rather incredible as they are at that.  The credit here must go to the actors. Ms Stewart is blessed with an expressive, almost Keatonesque melancholy in her eyes and brow which will only mellow with age, an A-list fundament, and she plays admirably to the camera.  As everyone in the world who watches movies knows at this point, Pattinson and K-Stew are beautiful people - which prompts one to reflect on how much more fun, though less of a shameless cash cow, such a film would have been, had at least some, if not all, of their romance had been shot au natural.

Obviously, there are several fans of anime who love this film, and I can see some of the reasons why.  I got this film, though, mostly for my children who love everything they have seen from Studio Ghibli, and did so on the strength of comparisons in the reviews posted here and elsewhere with the work of Miyazaki.  As it turned out, though, my kids became quite bored halfway through this film and lost interest in seeing it to the end.  I kept it on, but found myself drifting a bit as well.The visuals were stunning -- as good as any I have seen in animation. I also thought the story held promise and was overall touching, but also suffered from what seemed to me to be contradictory aims.  On the one hand, the filmmakers seemed to want a simple story about childhood friendships and dreams, that can be lost sight of for a time but possibly recaptured.  On the other hand, the filmmakers wanted a strong science fiction premise that explored the possibility of alternate realities.  I don't think either aspect worked as well as it could have.  The plot is not really, though, the main problem that I saw with this film; I think it had more to do with a feeling that the characters never felt to me as if they had been brought to life.  Some of the early sequences reminded me of the simple evocations of childhood and wonder found in Studio Ghibli's ""Whisper of the Heart"" -- but what carried that movie all the way through was the personalities and overall interest of the characters.  By contrast, I never felt very connected to the characters in this film, and my children didn't either.  My children's response to the film did not seem to have as much to do with the complicated storyline as its failure to create truly memorable and likeable characters.

Through its innovative, you-are-there style, this low-budget, independent thriller really drives that message home.The stalker in this case is a young man named Doug, a techno-savvy misfit with extreme sociopathic tendencies, who through an elaborate network of hidden microphones and cameras, has found a way to keep the object of his obsession - a beautiful young woman named Amy -  under surveillance literally 24 hours a day without her knowledge.  Slowly but surely, he worms his way into her life, manipulating her emotions and earning her trust along the way.In form as well as in style, ""Alone With Her"" is a cross between ""Peeping Tom"" and ""The Blair Witch Project,"" with the audience viewing the action entirely through the lenses of Doug's strategically placed cameras.  This innovative technique effectively puts us in the shoes of the voyeuristic stalker, making us, in some strange way, complicit in his actions - and isn't all moviewatching, when you get right down to it, just another form of voyeurism?  The real chill, of course, comes from the realization of just how easy modern technology has made it for our rights of personal space and privacy to be violated.  If this movie doesn't turn you into a raving paranoiac, nothing will.""Alone With Her"" is more than just a mere exercise in style, however.  Thanks to compelling performances from Ana Claudia Talancon, Colin Hanks (who appears off-screen for most of the film) and Jordana Spiro, the movie emerges as an engrossing human drama as well, one that makes us empathize with the various characters whose story we are being compelled to watch.  For beyond the threat posed by all the technical hardware, the film unnervingly points out the risk we all take by simply opening ourselves up to friendships and relationships with people we actually know very little about.Some people may find ""Alone With Her"" too low-keyed in its approach to be truly frightening.  However, it is just that lack of sensationalism that makes it so convincing in its creepiness.  It's true that the movie, like many thrillers, falls apart somewhat in its third act due to its budgetary constraints as well as a certain predictability in the plotting. Still, ""Alone With Her"" illustrates the truth of Marshall McLuhan's observation that ""the medium is the message"" better than any film of recent times.",3.0,0.9333333333333332,14,1,0.6652,very positive,0.9838,very positive,2007,7,4

Having grown up on and disecting the Romero films I now find the gore to be of secondary importance.Shock, human interaction, and an uncertainty of this weird happening are what holds the movie together well. I saw this in the theatres in 2004.What Night of the Living Dead captured with it's TV reports and unique fear, Dawn 2004 capitilized on. Thats why it worked so well. The main thing is that it made you think while holding the action. It had a few weak or rather bad moments, the baby birth seen didn't need to be there, it was cheasy to me. But back to basics, being chased in a mall by hundreds of flesh ripping zombies is strangely facinating. I liked this movie better then Land of the Dead even though they show two different types of zombies. The old school is good, but this new era of zombie is fast paced with that bizzare world ending feel. The first 15 minutes of the movie should grab any sci-fi buff without question.

First of all, there are no extras. I don't know why all artists don't release the music video's on these live dvd's; the two go together like peas in a pod.Then there's the actual preformance. When I saw she preformed for nearly two hours. How did we get down to 1 hour and 15 minutes (which isn't true; it's about an hour and twenty minutes)? So many songs are shortened (Hot and Runaway), and other hits we look foward to despite this being a support for Best damn thing are shortened and made acoustic.This is supposed to be a live rock concert (or pop, whatever), not avril lavigne live acoustic. Boring, snooze through those songs.Then we look foward to see her sing Joan Jetts's Bad Reputation and instead we see video footage over it, no actual live preformance here.And all the dance interludes were pointless. It's cute during ""Girlfriend,"" ""I Can Do Better,"" ""I Don't Have To Try,"" and ""The Best Damn Thing,"" but otherwise it's pretty pointless and doesn't fit.This could've been great; instead it looks like Avril Lavigne is either too tired to preform good anymore or is just a lazy sell-out.As I must repeat, I saw her on her support tour for Under My Skin and she was beyond excellent. She did almost all of her songs from both albums. There's no reason why we couldn't have done 1/3 of each album here, or at least 1/2 BDT and 1/2 the other two.Overall, this will only dissapoint.

The first two were excellent and helped, perhaps, pull more people toward the comic book world. Number 2, in particular, was astonishingly good in that we got to see how much Spidey had to give up in order to be the man he had to be. And with the mondo-budget given to this third film (something like $250 million, I believe, which was only recently eclipsed by the $300 million Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End), one would suspect that it would hold onto its previous successes by following a somewhat similar format.But no...Although loaded with action and some top-notch special effects, the film is overloaded with too many characters and some unwontedly bad scenes that were in need of excision.This time Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire,The Good German) is up against not one, not two, not three, but four evil forces. Although this sounds enticing, there's no way (NO WAY!) anything approaching cohesion could happen for this 139 minute film: an evil, outerspace symbiote that attaches itself to Spidey's suit; Green Goblin Jr./Harry Osborn, played by the returning James Franco (Tristan and Isolde); Sandman/Flint Marko played by Thomas Haden Church (CHARLOTTE'S WEB); and, eventually, Venom/Eddie Brock, played by Topher Grace.I'm not sure what Mr. Raimi was thinking, but more is not necessarily ""more,"" if you catch my meaning. Audiences don't need impossible odds to enjoy a hero's journey into darkness and back; we just need a good story that holds together.Oh, and we definitely don't need a woosie Spider-Man crying in every other scene. The guy's a superhero, make him act like one for crying out loud!It's still nice to see the beautiful Kirsten Dunst (Elizabethtown) in her role as Mary Jane the love interest. She can act well and she's believable in every scene, it just that she gets lost amongst the overly crowded cast, too, just like the Sandman and Venom do.Too many questions about what's happening plague the middle of the film but are wrapped up in slipshod fashion at the very rushed ending.It isn't all bad, though. The scenes with Spider-Man and Sandman together are shot well, with the special effects taking center-stage more than the story or the actors themselves. The death of a pivotal character is handled well but, again, the tears are overdone and make Spidey look wimpish.Perhaps the next Spider-Man film will help put this one behind us as ""the bad one.""

Everything about the characterization is severely overproduced and it's a major interference to me.  The entire script feels like a bloated mess as a result.  I hate it.  A comparison to a high school auditorium play is honestly totally appropriate.  The acting is borderline unbearable.However, the most shocking aspect of the Wolfman is the way it's somehow able to move beyond all that cheesy and unnecessary play-like acting and focus on really intense and downright disgustingly violent segments that involve a Wolfman going crazy in the woods and attacking people randomly.  Make no mistake about it- the amount of blood you will experience is REALLY high and the segments themselves are incredibly graphic.  Expect decapitations and other intense types of violence courtesy of the Wolfman's sneak attacks.Talk about surprising the way the movie writers went back and forth between two drastically different writing styles that honestly don't blend very well together, which will definitely make it extremely hard for most people to admire a movie like the Wolfman and will therefore struggle to enjoy the overdramatic acting in between the blood and violence.

The moral bankruptcy of the media is at the core of this movie, intertwined with the flaws of the judicial system.Oleg and Emil respectively are a Russian and a Czech, that want to make it in the US with their very personal version of living the American dream. They videotape a series of murders and try to hock these fruits of their labour to the media. Lighting their way on the road of this American tradition is a notorious criminal who had been found guilty on a series of murders, manages to get an insanity plee and subsequently sells the rights to his story in a million dollar deal.Attempts to obstruct Oleg and Emil in achieving their goal is Eddie Flemming (de Niro), police detective, media celebrity, flamboyant and experienced who always does well in front of a camera with juicy stories and arrests. He's put on their case and finds himself partnered with fire inspector Jordy Warsaw (Edward Burns) who gets involved after one of Oleg and Emil's pr-stunts includes torching an entire appartment block, with its inhabitants still inside that is.I will not give away how it all ends, but will divulge that a pretty big surprise is in store for de Niro's character.On first sight it's pretty standard Hollywood fare and in part that's true, the obligatory ingredients to a crime story are there. What lifts the movie just a notch above the average are four things:- The excellent cast- The sharp attack on the media- The equally sharp attack on the judicial system- The manipulation of the audienceThe latter I should explain: The viewer is manipulated into feeling sympathy to some degree for the two villains who commit the most terrible and atrocious crimes, giving him a firsthand experience as to how easy it is that these kind of psychopaths can become media ""heroes"". It reminds us of our own dark side, the fascination we have for this kind of criminals, we want to see and it's never enough, the way people look at someone, just to pick a real event I read in a newspaper, being kicked to death and everybody looking on transfixed but no one interferes and not just only out of fear. Man has a dark fascination with violence and crime, if that weren't the case, then all these reality cop tv shows wouldn't have the ratings they have and they would have disappeared from tv. The fact that these kind of shows, covering the whole spectrum from petty crime to the most serious variety (like a documentary series portraying the most notorious US serial killers), have only increased in popularity over the years, which saids enough.In this light I believe we should very much understand that an accusation  towards the media indirectly is also a moral finger pointing at us and to me that is the most important effect of the movie, though one may easily choose to ignore this aspect and simply come to the conclusion of having watched an average cops & robbers movie.Unfortunately there's also a lot to be said against this movie: its themes have been addressed before and in most ways I regret to say much better. Films like ""Broadcast News"" and ""Network"" come to mind when it comes to critically focussing on the media, while a movie like ""Natural Born Killers"" like this movie links the glorification of violence in the media with our own part in it and in a far superior way than ""15 Minutes"".De Niro is acting on auto-pilot and has effectively the movie stolen from him by the dynamic duo Karel Roden and Oleg Taktarov, both quite unknown at the time. Naturally they couldn't leave well enough alone and a contrived love story was thrown into the already convoluted mix.Nevertheless it's a movie that is worth a look, but I don't think it will stand many repeated viewings.",3.0,0.0,1,1,0.4404,positive,-0.9165,very negative,2007,1,27

The main guy is played by Val Kilmer as one of these humorless Hollywood heroes for whom there is no obstacle which can't be overcome and whose backstory, as they say, has hidden depths of tragedy and alienation. Mamet insures that we see the guy's back without his shirt on and it's not a pretty sight.

But despite its showy jump-cuts and narrative drive, it's not really a very true adaptation of the original Dickens novel: for one thing, there's very little of the polluted fog (what we would call smog today) that completely permeates Dickens's London from the novel's opening words, and all the rooms look carefully swept--the London poor live on far too clean and grand a scale (Mr. Krook's rag-and-bone shop practically looks inviting in this adaptation).

These days there is a fascination with trying to re-do every popular movie from the past when in most cases those movies should just be left alone, and Robocop is a good example of why.In all fairness, the new Robocop has a different enough story to be its own, but falls flat in too many ways. I did enjoy seeing more of a focus on Alex Murphy's family, which was an afterthought in the original, and I liked Gary Oldmans moral dilemma as the doctor that created Robocop. Unfortunately just about every other aspect of this version does not live up to the original.I was just a kid when the old Robocop came out in 1987. I still remember the feeling of horror watching Alex Murphy get s*** up in the scene that causes him to become Robocop. The movie set the story in a believable way. Detroit, a city falling apart with a horrible crime problem and not enough finances to have a police force capable of stopping the bad guys (though who knew back then that nearly 20 years later Detroit would be almost like the movie!)The new Robocop is not a bad movie. It just doesnt quite do what it needs to, especially in comparison with the original. The premise, or setting, of the modern film is believable, but doesn't give the same feeling of the originals dystopian Detroit therefore the viewer does not care as much about what is going on.In the original Alex Murphy had a female partner with a larger role in the movie. In this one the partner is an afterthought. Part of the problem may be the casting choice of Joel Kinnaman. He did ok, but Gary Oldman as the doctor stole the show and that's really not how it should have been. OCP was also not the big bad guys like in the original movie. You learned to hate them and their CEO Dick Jones, played by Ronny Cox, while in this version I didn't care at all about Michael Keaton. He wasn't evil so much as ambitious and greedy.Ultimately the theme that keeps running through my head after watching this movie is I just didn't care. The premise, story, and in some cases the cast itself, made it so that it is difficult to have any emotional connection to the movie as the viewer. The story as it was set up in the re-make felt rushed and just left something to be desired. It also needed more action. I liked seeing Robocop take on crime in the original. For the most part that was non-existent in this movie, or at best talked about, but you never see it in action.The original Robocop had its own issues at times, but the new re-make just does not do it justice. Its a movie worth renting when you are bored and want to watch something that you will mostly forget about once its over. Having this movie use a different story, while commendable for not being a carbon copy of the original, is also its downfall because the story and the setting are this movies weakest points.Those that have never seen the original movie will probably like this one more, but many of us that were around when the original came out will not be satisfied by this new version.",3.0,0.0,1,2,0.0,neutral,-0.8008,very negative,2014,6,4

Stephen King once made a sort of fundamental distinction between terror, horror and the gross out.  &quot;The Dentist&quot; is a textbook example of the gross out that is so over the top that you just have to laugh (assuming you have not already ejected the tape).  The story is about Dr. Allan Feinstone (Corbin Bersen) who has everything from the big house and the beautiful wife to a great job as the friendly upper class neighborhood dentist.  But then he discovers his wife is having an affair with their pool boy and he goes right off the deep end.  In some sort of perverse Pavlovian twist, after taking care of the offending couple every time he encounter any of the normal dental problems of his patients, such as tooth decay or plaque, he decides to teach them a final lesson on dental hygiene.  Meanwhile, Dr. Feinstone is being stalked by an even greater evil: the I.R.S.The idea that your dentist is fiend from hell is not exactly new.  If you did not already know this from personal experience then you have such classical examples as &quot;The Little Shop of Horrors&quot; and the pilot for &quot;Alias.&quot;  Then there is &quot;Marathon Man,&quot; where Laurence Olivier confirmed our worst fears: to wit, your dentist is a Nazi.  However, &quot;The Dentist&quot; is in a class by itself as a tongue in cheek splatter flick.  The people who put this movie together know that as soon as that dentist drill starts whizzing they have 99% of their audience cringing and they just pour it on.  I think this film is clearly intended to be more camp than legitimate horror.  This film won the Jury Grand Prize at the 1996 Sweden Fantastic Film Festival.  Mull that one over for a while.

The few shocking moments are fleeting and exploitative, with no lasting impact left in their wake.

True, he had taken the concept straight from the overused Mayan Calendar hype, and much of the plot from Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer's 1933 classic SF novel, ""When Worlds Collide"" (if I were one of the authors' heirs, I'd call a good lawyer!), but I was impressed that, for once, Emmerich's usual collection of blue-collar heroes couldn't come up with an easy 'fix' to solve things.

The answer: pacing.  The script was obviously very long-winded and it seems that among the crew members that should help this get cut down to interesting (producer, director, editor) no one seemed to be able to work out these kinks.  The result is a nice addition to the Freddy collection, but unfortunately you may find yourself halfway to dreamland yourself while you wait for the plot to unfold.Alice and Dan return from the previous movie, deeply in love with eachother and celebrating their high school graduation.  Things seem to be moving along great except that Alice keeps getting little hints that Freddy might be trying to come back.  For some reason this idea is proposterous and even if it was possible, the first death (which happens to be Dan's) occurs while both Alice and Dan are awake!  While Alice tries to discover how Freddy can be working without anyone being asleep, her friends begin to yet again become victims of Freddy.  Eventually Alice discovers that she is pregnant and when her unborn child sleeps, Freddy is free to enter Alice's world and attack her friends.  Now Alice has to figure out how she can defeat Kruger while also preventing her unborn son from becoming his prodigy in the process.This movie did have an incredible feel to it, and although I have no idea who the Art Director was, I do tip my hat to them.  The look has this dark gothic feel to it whenever her child begins to dream.  I also liked the seemingly obvious planning involved in the sets as they all tend to transform from normal to creepy with the greatest of ease.  The performances don't really lack, with none of the acting coming off as humerous, and Robert England delivers another great performance as Freddy Kruger.  I also liked the attempt they made at making this movie a little more scary than the previous film had been.  My only real complaint deals with the pacing, many people will tune out because it just takes to long for the movie to progress.  Because the writer didn't want to reveal that Alice's child is the cause of the whole situation until later, you wander through the first half of the film with a puzzled look.The DVD gets a little bit of an upgrade with special features.  The movie is presented in widescreen and I'm happy to see the 5.1 although by this point it's expected.  The DVD-ROM features add the script and trivia questions and of course we have our ""Jump To A Dream"" sequence.  In conclusion, this movie was visually stunning, but the writing was paced so slowly that the 89 mins the movie lasts feels more like two hours!  I think the script was really skimpy in actual plot that it had to be filled with fluffer back story on Amanda Kruger which I don't really care about at this point.

On Sir Bobby's part perhaps since he displays the subtlest hints of attraction though the romance is underdeveloped and there is little suggestion of chemistry on Pidgeon's part.I'm not sure what the point was but it seems that the original film version is considered by many of the reviewers to be much superior and in keeping with Rattigan's intent. I think I'll put it on my watchlist.Lackluster and worth seeing only if you are into dry drama, Hawthorn's acting, or as a good friend once said--'I only ask two things concerning historical productions: Is Jeremy Northam starring and is he wearing tights?'

While I was watching it I got a little bored and some scenes tempted me to laugh. If you've seen 1963's ""The Haunting,"" 1973's ""The Exorcist"" and 1944's ""The Uninvited"" you've seen three much better films from which ""The Conjuring"" gets its bag of tricks.Probably any clever film student could make something like this movie. We all know the basic ingredients: a large, old house in an isolated setting. The house should be attractive but something about it makes it ugly. It's in New England. It's autumn: cold winds blow skittering dead leaves. An innocent family moves into the house. The family is generic, without too many details; they are All-American and the audience can identify with them. They do normal things like go to the beach and watch ""The Brady Bunch.""Their new home contains many dark and dusty nooks and crannies. There are antique curios that look a bit menacing.Suddenly, during a quiet night, a strange noise is heard. For some reason, no one in this family ever switches on normal lighting. Rather, they use weak flashlights or match flames.An innocent child arises from bed in a long white nightgown. She moves slowly, slowly, slowly, down a dark hall to investigate the noise. The scene is very quiet, very long, and very repetitive. You know that eventually the innocent child is going to come across something unusual: a vision of a hanged person, the reflection of a ghost in a mirror, or something truly terrifying, an IRS man there to conduct an audit.You know that at the same moment that the defenseless family member sees the unusual thing, the previously silent scene will burst with sudden, loud, and oppressive noise. The sudden vision and noise will startle you, and you will be scared. What you paid the ticket price for. Oh, and the family dog dies, birds act weird, and mom is bruising easily.At first, of course, everyone in the house writes off these events as mere chance. Everyone is rational and is not tempted to believe in the supernatural. Eventually someone in the family levitates or clocks stop or people feel cold or something. Just like in ""The Haunting,"" there are loud banging noises. Just as in ""The Uninvited,"" a family member is possessed by the dark energies of the house, and there is the ghost of a bad mother and a not-so-bad mother. Just as in ""The Exorcist,"" there will be an exorcism.So the team of experts is brought in. They speak some ancient language like Latin and possess arcane knowledge. I won't tell you any more because that would reveal the end of the movie to you, but I bet you can guess.I'll just say that at one point, the satanic shenanigans in the house reach fever pitch. Satan is beating the stuffing out of these poor fools. Any sane person would immediately evacuate. At that point a paranormal investigator, Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) says, ""Leaving the house won't help because the dark spirits have attached themselves to you."" OH COME ON. Vera Farmiga may as well have said, ""You can't leave now because there's still forty-five minutes to go in the movie.""Vera Farmiga is a scintillating actress. She electrifies every scene she is in. Patrick Wilson is perfect as her husband; they have great chemistry. The movie wastes them, though. The filmmakers don't seem to realize that Farmiga's human depth and complexity are the best thing the movie has going for it, and utilizing that human power would have made their film a classic, rather than just another ""Boo!"" movie.""The Excorsist,"" ""The Haunting"" and ""The Uninvited"" are all scary but they are also deep. They present big themes. ""The Conjuring"" avoids big themes. One character tries to kill another, and it's the kind of killing that makes your skin crawl. The movie makes no attempt to plumb these murky waters.""The Conjuring"" misrepresents evil and Catholicism. When the Warrens arrive at the haunted house, Lorraine has a rosary strung from her wrist. Ed Warren places little wooden crucifixes around the house. In the exorcism scene, Latin is spoken. This isn't true spirituality; it's fetishism - the belief that objects and rituals possess supernatural power. They do not. Only God has power. I am a Catholic, I pray the rosary, and I believe in Satan. The force that defies Satan is not an object, a rosary, it is rather faith in God.The Haunting[[ASIN:B00DZP1C8Q[[ASIN:B00DZP1C8Q The Uninvited (Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]]]",3.0,0.4285714285714285,2,3,-0.2732,negative,-0.9923,very negative,2013,8,3

This DVD contains all the special features included in this box set.  The first extra is labeled as ""Original Closing & Openings.""  This includes both of the openings and both of the closings for Super Dimension Fortress Macross, the opening and closing for Super Dimensional Cavalry Southern Cross, the opening and closing for Genesis Climber Mospeada, and the opening and closing for Robotech.  It should be noted that only the Robotech opening and closing are textless versions; all the others have their original Japanese text.

That leads me to believe that Harmony Gold doesn't have a version of the opening and closing of Robotech that has sound effects, but no text.The next extra is ""Animation Model Sheets.""  There are twenty-nine pages of characters, twenty-nine pages of mecha, twenty-six pages of the Armies of the Southern Cross, and ten pages of backgrounds.  The ""Armies of the Southern Cross"" model sheets include drawings for the various levels of the Southern Cross military, and highlighting their various insignias and their uniforms and/or battle armor.Next, there is a gallery of ""Masters Comic Covers.""  These are the covers for the comic books that were released to chronicle the Robotech Masters portion of the Robotech television series.  There are twenty-four covers in all, and you can scroll through them at your own pace.There are also two clips included in the ""International Clips"" feature.  The first clip is when Dana first takes command of the 15th Squadron, and leads her troops out for a joyride.  The second scene is when the 15th Squadron gets into a brawl with Marie Crystal's unit.

It may be the very best example why so many of the films of MGM, the Tiffany of its day, have not stood the test of time. MGM spent truck loads of money and mounted the biggest show in the cinema but in doing so, they removed almost all vestiges of vitality and wit. At least the over-the-top no expense spared approach mirrored Ziegfield himself and it should be noted that the screenplay is a reasonably accurate depiction of his life and times. The art direction, costuming and sense of period, also, are lush and accurate. William Powell is good casting as Ziegfield but Myrna Loy has little to do as Billie Burke. Luise Rainer won a famous Oscar for her smiling through tears phone scene but this was the year Greta Garbo was up for ""Camille"". Are you kidding? Fanny Brice (""Funny Girl"") appears too and every moment is solid gold but it is a tragedy that her version of ""My Man"" is truncated.The DVD print of the film is only OK which is disappointing. There is a short film about the making of the film and this is invaluable because appearances are made by Ziegfield's daughter and Luise Rainer herself.

1038686,B000LC4ZDA,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,74,79,2007-03-30,"Not Great Hemingway, but a Memorable Misfire!","""The Sun Also Rises"" was 20th Century Fox's big-budget 'prestige' filmfor 1957, based on Ernest Hemingway's first novel, shot on location in Paris and Mexico (substituting for Spain), and starring the studio's long-reigning superstar, Tyrone Power, surrounded by legendary actors (Ava Gardner, Errol Flynn, Mel Ferrer, and Eddie Albert). With all the talent assembled in front of and behind the camera, producer Darryl F. Zanuck felt confident that the film would be an enduring classic for both his own independent company, and his studio.It wasn't, unfortunately...The film's problem was a fundamental one; the 'Lost Generation'Hemingway wrote of were disillusioned young Americans, who, shatteredby the horror and brutality of the 'Great War', lost their innocence, and became a 'live fast, die young' crowd of expatriates, settling in Paris. These were men and women still in their twenties and thirties...yet the film's stars were all ten to twenty years older! The most glaring case can be seen in the film's star, Tyrone Power. As newspaperman Jake Barnes, a vet whose war injuries render him impotent, unable to satisfy the woman he loves (Ava Gardner), and, therefore, the 'perfect' observer of her romantic entanglements with other men, Power seems more a victim of a midlife crisis than a young man devastated about losing his manhood. In his next-to-last film, Power, at 44, was aging badly, his hair thinning and his slender, 'movie idol' good looks surrendering to a middle-aged paunch. Only when he smiles do the years seem to lift, a bit, and the ""too handsome to be true"" younger man appears. Adding to his physical deterioration was an undiagnosed heart condition, which would kill him, in less than two years.His co-star, Ava Gardner, at 35, was going through a decline, as well, but, like her character, Lady Brett Ashley, her vices were the cause of her self-destruction. Both Brett and Ava were hedonistic women too fond of booze, bullfighters, and nightlife, and Ava's once-classic features were beginning to develop bags and wrinkles that makeup and lighting couldn't hide.Coming off best are Errol Flynn and Eddie Albert. Flynn, at 48, long past his 'glamorous' prime (he and Power had been Hollywood's best-looking 'swashbucklers' of the early 40s), had become a very credible character actor, usually portraying variations of himself. His 'Mike Campbell', an alcoholic, impoverished but clinging to his pride, was, sadly, a dead-on assessment of Errol Flynn, as well. Like Power, he would be dead in two years, a victim of his own excesses. On the other hand, Eddie Albert, at 49, had long been health-conscious, and his performance as a drunk was simply good acting; paired with Flynn, they 'steal' the film, particularly during the famous Pamplona bull run, when the duo flee for their lives (while guzzling wine), and Flynn attempts to use a bad check as a cape to 'fight' a bull!The drama seems overdrawn, the romance lacks 'fire', Robert Evans as a young bullfighter is dreadful, and the resolution is a hollow one. Even with the gorgeous scenery, Hugo Friedhofer's soaring film score, and Henry King's skill as a director, the film fails to generate more than a curiosity value, at the sight of so many actors, past their prime, trying to seem youthful and dynamic.The DVD offers many 'added features', including 'behind the scenes' photos of Power, Flynn, and Gardner, and director Henry King's audio reminiscences of the production, possibly more entertaining than the feature, itself.All-in-all, an ambitious misfire!",3.0,0.9367088607594936,3,1,-0.3483,negative,0.9337,very positive,2007,3,30

Afterall they are both stories that revolve around a disillusioned prep school youth. However, this movie is not a film version of the book. Holden Caulfield's character is desribed foremost by his relationships and his thoughts on the people around him. He manages to find the fleshy side of all of his aquantances, even those who he despises. His commentary is thourough and critical, yet remains sympathetic  . Igby is desribed by his relationships as well, but with these interactions we almost only see his pessimism and sarcasm. His critiques are plentiful, but we never really see him as any more than a young boy carelessly lashing out at a world that is, by his standards, so &quot;f---ing  hypocritical&quot;.He only seems to care about  others when he is interested in having sex with them. And whereas Holden is a character plagued by paralysis and pensiveness, Igby is  only too willing to sell drugs,run away, get expelled, and sleep with his uncle's mistress. In this way, the movie and book are different, and in this way, the book is far superior.cast and actingThe cast that was assembled for this movie is for the most  part famous. The casting of was very appropriate, and impressive given the film's small budget. The movie is Kieran Culkin's vehichle and he plays the rich boy smartass very well. The rest of the supporting cast are impressive and charismatic, especially jared harris and jeff goldblum. Ryan Phillipe seems to be perfectly  well suited to the WASP character that he has already played in cruel intentions. The movie has some charm and its moments. The conversational sparring between Culkin and Harris in the New York, using a yoga ball as an illustrating prop was  interesting and funny (Money bags... take me away!) . The absurd shrink at &quot;Clipped Wings&quot; is a fun comic interlude, and seems to be improvised.Part of the fun of the movie is that, although it centers around pretentious people, It doesnt really take itself too seriously. There isn't revelatory. None of the characters change (except for dying) and the message seems to be less than clear. Igby is not a sympathetic character and it is hard to be sympathetic for him.

283182,630197204X,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,2,5,2010-04-21,Better than I Remembered,"I remember seeing this movie in the theater when it was first released and it really did not create much of an impression on me.  As a matter of fact, unlike other Peckinpah westerns I had seen like ""The Wild Bunch"" or ""Major Dundee,"" I found it to be quite forgettable.  However I did not know at the time that MGM butchered this picture up in the editing room.I just watched the re-edited, remastered edition from 2005 and found it to be enjoyable (if one can really call such a bleak film enjoyable.)  The basic premise is Sheriff Pat Garrett, bought and paid for by the rich ranchers, hunting his old friend Billy the Kid down (with the basic purpose of killing him.)  Billy is portrayed as a fun-loving Robin Hood-type beloved by the little people while Garrett is dour and unhappy.  James Coburn plays Garrett and the only scene where he seems truly happy is in an orgy with five prostitutes.  Kris Kristoferson plays Billy as the outlaw with a heart of gold and Bob Dylan wanders through the film with the almost no dialogue and the same expression on his face.  (He does supply the music.)  The really cool thing about this movie though is that it features almost every veteran western character actor around at the time: Jack Elam, Chill Wills, Slim Pickens, L.Q. Jones, Gene Evans, R.G. Armstrong, they're all here.  (I checked the cast on the second disc which featured a 1988 TCM cut of the film and saw Dub Taylor and Elisha Cook, Jr mentioned.  I did not see them in the 2005 version I watched.)Also featured briefly are Jason Robards and in an obvious homage to ""The Tall Man,"" the early 1960s western wherein he played Pat Garrett, Barry Sullivan.  (Sullivan played John Chisum, the real-life rancher played by John Wayne in the 1970 western named appropriately ""Chisum"")Most of the film features Coburn riding into town and running into outlaws that he formerly rode with or other lawmen that were previously outlaws, confronting other outlaws who are friends of Billy and blowing them away.  Everyone knows each other in this film and everyone rode together at some point.  There are two rather sad scenes that reflect this.  In one, Garrett rides into town and gets the tired-out town sheriff, played by the great Slim Pickens, to assist him in confronting some of Billy's buddies.  The sheriff who just wants to retire and sail away in his boat dutifully joins Garrett along with his deputy, also his wife, played by the famous Mexican actress Katy Jurado.  Of course, he gets ""gut-shot"" during the unnecessary confrontation and winds up staring at the water while his lifeblood flows away, his sobbing wife, soon widow, at his side.  There is not a word said and Dylan's ""Knockin on Heaven's Door"" is played in the background.  A very well-done scene.Like most Peckinpah films, life means very little.  One minute you are alive and the next you're dead.  Another excellent scene reflects this.  A former outlaw, played by the legendary Jack Elam, is deputized by Garrett after knowing him for about one minute.  One night he is eating dinner with a hard-bitten rancher (Gene Evans) and his wife and kids when Billy, who also knows the rancher, stops in for a bite.  He shows Billy the badge and basically realizes that this means his end.  You can see him attempting to think of another way out, rather than the shootout that he has been forced into, without success.  This scene ends the way we expect it to, with Elam also ""knockin on heaven's door"" as  rancher Evans and his family look on impassively.  Like the other, a very affecting scene.The dvd featured commentary by four Peckinpah scholars.  I did not listen to the commentary although I did hear the same four do the audio commentary on Peckinpah's ""Major Dundee"" and they obviously know what they are talking about.  There is a fairly short interview with Peckinpah's long-time ""companion"" (girlfriend?) and editor.  There is an interview with Kristofferson which I did not watch, (hes never been one of my favorites,) and two songs from him.  There are trailers of other Peckinpah films on dvd and a trailer for a set featuring James Dean's films!  (I'm not sure exactly what he has to do with this film.)In conclusion, this is a sad, bleak Peckinpah western.  It features the usual amount of Peckinpah bloodshed and a lot of great western character actors.  You may not be smiling when its over but it is still a fairly good film.",3.0,0.4,2,2,0.4404,positive,0.9475,very positive,2010,4,21
238540,630027179X,AQVBOVE8P7K3J,3,11,2011-07-09,"Visually Striking, but Narratively a Mess","There are some visual shots and sequences in this film that are breathtakingly good: the wedding sequence, Arthur's initial introduction to Lancelot, and Perceval's spectacularly eerie quest for the grail to name a few. Plus, Wagner has seldom been better used in a movie. Great stuff here, with sequences that stick in my mind more than twenty years after I first saw the film. So why just the three stars?Two reasons, really. As visually striking as this film is, the script isn't especially solid or coherent. It may be relatively faithful to Malory's original text, but literal faithfulness to a literary source isn't always a good thing. This film presupposes knowledge of the source material that many viewers may not have, so that specific narrative events occasionally seem to unfold without any explanation or context. That kind of context-free thing may happen all the time in real life, but in narrative you need some sort of bridge between events.The second problem lies with the performances - which are inconsistent, to say the least, and too often veer toward egregious overacting. That overacting sort of works in actor Nicol Williamsons favor (Merlin is supposed to be odd, after all), but it works less well with Nigel Terry's Arthur and other supporting roles. In fact, Terry overacts so much that he just looks like he's trying too hard. And since he's playing the lead role... Well, you get the point. Helen Mirren is solid, though, and it's always fun to see a young Gabriel Byrne, Liam Neeson, and a pre-Picard Patrick Stewart.",3.0,0.2727272727272727,1,2,-0.5023,negative,0.9656,very positive,2011,7,9

Quantum Physics, the study of what occurs at the level of sub-atomic particles, deals with such issues as what is reality, what is matter, what is time and space.  The film addresses these topics mainly through interviews with top scientists and thinkers, who manage to keep the discussion reasonably coherent for even scientifically illiterate persons like myself.  They discuss in lengthy detail the existence and nature of God, the structure of the universe, and the ways in which the elements that make up the human mind and body create the feelings and emotions we experience on a daily basis.  It's all very ""out there,"" but fun as a brain teaser, if you go in for that sort of thing.The film itself is a bit of a mixed bag in terms of its overall quality.

His original doctor was on vacation so he saw a substitute.  As he was talking with his personal life he discovers that he has a daughter named Angela with his ex-girlfriend Heather.  Roy is now put in a serious bind as not only is he about to set his biggest score, he is now having to take responsibilities as a father and try to keep her from getting involved in his work.  Of course his daughter isn't what you call a saint.  She smokes like he does, drinks, and has been arrested for shoplifting despite being a minor.  When she find out what he did for a living, she was impressed and does encourage her father to teach her a few things.  She does end up involved in her dad's next con with his partner Frank.  Of course, the con didn't go as planned as the guy they screwed was hot in pursuit of Roy.  The guy even showed up at his house with Frank being helded hostage and in demand with at least half the cut that he owed.  His daughter end up accidentlly killing the guy in attempt to defend her father.  Now all three of their lives are in jeopardy, but Angela is the only one that Roy is really concerned about.  He has frank drive off with her far away and try to hook up on a later day.  However, Roy talks to Heather and discovers that when she was pregnant, she had a miscarriage.  Roy was hurt and felt betrayed but as he promised Angela during the movie, he does give up cons and works at a furniture store where he mets Angela one year later.  Even though he was disappointed with being set up, they do reconcile their differences. Nicholas Cage and the girl who played Angela were the only saving graces of this movie.  They worked well together.  The movie had a great story but it was hard to stay focused throughout the whole movie as they showed too many scenes of him looking for his medication and making trips to the drug store which I thought was a little unnecessary.  It is at least worthy of a rental, then you can draw your own conclusions.",3.0,0.0,2,2,0.2263,positive,-0.842,very negative,2004,3,9

850852,B0002YCUZW,AFEU1F4TXQWKL,5,8,2005-01-28,GITS: Stand Alone Complex Vol. 3: A Little Uninteresting,"This set contains episodes nine through twelve of the first series/season from Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. This third volume is probably the low point in the series; not necessarily bad, but not particularly exciting or interesting - at least at first. Two involve plots with the Laughing Man, one very obvious, the other not so much until the end. Another plot thread involving the AI tanks, the Tachikomas, also comes to the fore and really makes it mark later in the series.Here is an episode summary (in order, with some spoilers if you hadn't seen the previous episode):CHAT! CHAT! CHAT!: Admittedly it would be extremely hard to make twenty minutes of animation mostly involving a virtual chat room exciting or even interesting. After the events of the previous episodes involving Section 9's investigation into the Laughing Man, the Major decides to consult with others interested in the legendary hacker figure. Appearing in a virtual chat room at Virtual City Alpha (in a different form), Kusanagi participates in a varied debate over the origins of the Laughing Man, his supposed return, the change in behavior (the assassination announcement), and the phenomenon of the stand alone complex. While the background of the original appearance of the Laughing Man is fleshed out and some questions from the previous episodes are answered, not a lot really happens here and it's just that - a lot of talk.JUNGLE CRUISE: A serial killer appears in Japan, gruesomely skinning his victims alive in a T-shirt style pattern. Unfortunately for Batou, the pattern is very familiar, bringing up a lot of memories he'd probably rather forget. Even more unfortunately for Batou, two CIA agents show up and really don't help matters any. It is interesting to note that, in a flashback sequence, Batou appears as he did in the original manga (with short, cropped hair). Not a bad episode all around - the CIA agents show up rather unexpectedly in the second season.PORTRAITZ: Togusa gets assigned an undercover job at an institution for sufferers of closed cyberbrain syndrome - mostly kids but a few adults as well. There are some strange things happening. Parts of the episode can be confusing and may require a second viewing (but you bought it on DVD so you're in luck). Pay close attention the various literary passages, they work on a number of levels. Parts of this episode closely resemble the first issue of the manga.ESCAPE FROM: The episode title represents two halves of stories involving escapism. The first half involves a Tachikoma who inadvertently activates in the middle of the night and, child-like curiosity taking the best of it, decides to go out on a jaunt. In the second half, the Tachikoma evidently returned to Section 9 where it is underdoing a strict examination. In its misadventures, the Tachikoma managed to shoplift a junk cyberbrain that seemingly traps anyone that dives into it - in a movie theater. Another episode that seemingly doesn't go anywhere, though the oddness of the Tachikomas becomes a new plot twist.Obviously this isn't the best selection of episodes, and unfortunately in a complete series a limited number of episodes (in order) sometimes isn't the best way to get a sampling of the show. This is one of those circumstances and is the only reason why I'm giving this particular volume three stars. The animation remains excellent though somewhat varied (PORTRAITZ is definitely the best in this volume), and the sound is superb. This volume comes with interviews with the voice talent behind Batou (Akio Otsuka) and the series sound director (Kazuhiro Wakabayashi).The deluxe version comes with the original release, a second DVD with a DTS 5.1 sound version of the show, and a T-shirt featuring the art from the volume cover (Motoko's online persona, though the art resembles the manga more than the anime).",3.0,0.625,1,1,-0.25,negative,0.9938,very positive,2005,1,28

591107,B00005JKTI,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,4,9,2003-02-23,Sullen Sentiment,"The Academy Awards has done it again.  Take an obscure picture about a simple subject, bequeath it with several nominations from the major categories (Best Actress, Best Picture, Best Director), smother every movie trailer that airs on TV with propaganda (complete with rave quotes from magazines and newspapers) and everyone will feel compelled to rush out and see it.The aftermath?  Most people are incredulous that they spent $8 on something they wouldn&#65533;t have looked at twice at their local Blockbuster.&#65533;The Hours&#65533; has relied on the glitter of marketing since it opened nationwide in January 2003 and it takes advantage of every favorable critique it receives.  The result is a continued and reliable box office profit that will persevere through late March if it manages to win a few Oscars.The movie begins with a simultaneous look at the morning routines of the three pivotal characters &#65533; first off, in the year 1921, novelist Virginia Woolf (Kidman) awakens in her Richmond, England home to the sound of her doctor whispering to her husband Leonard (Dillane) downstairs.  The next clip takes place thirty years later in 1951 with pregnant housewife Laura Brown (Moore) sleeping soundly as her husband Dan (Reilly) roots around the kitchen.  Lastly, in the year 2001, Clarissa Vaughn (Streep) slaps her alarm clock with a heavy hand as she rises from bed, planning an extravagant dinner party for her friend Richard (Harris) who has just won a prestigious award for his latest novel.  All three women wrestle their inner demons throughout the film, Woolf battling schizophrenia; Brown, dissatisfaction with her cursory and monotonous life and Vaughn with her feelings toward Richard, tortured by the reality that he will soon die from a long, arduous battle with AIDS.The entire film alternates between the different eras in which these women live, forming interesting parallels as aspects of their personalities and lives are revealed.  Woolf writes her pivotal novel &#65533;Mrs. Dalloway&#65533; while contemplating thoughts of suicide, Brown reads &#65533;Mrs. Dalloway&#65533; and also contemplates suicide and Vaughn&#65533;s life seems to mirror the book altogether, the start of her day echoing the very first line of Woolf&#65533;s novel.The biggest setback with David Hare&#65533;s screenplay (who has only written for the stage and TV) is not only loss of characterization but also a distinct amount of insight into the characters&#65533; psychological dissension.  The adaptation of Pulitzer-prize winning author Michael Cunningham&#65533;s 228-page novel to a two-hour film forfeits a considerable amount of poeticism and personification, a detail that most times cannot be avoided when adapting a book to a movie.  What is ultimately confusing is the homoeroticism incorporated into the story, Julianne Moore&#65533;s liplock with Toni Collette and Nicole Kidman&#65533;s passionate smooch with Miranda Richardson utterly perplexing.Most of Cunningham&#65533;s beautiful prose is retained in the story&#65533;s central figure - as Woolf, Kidman manipulates the pastoral dialogue with ease, her delivery rarely coming off as cliched or strained.  This is a high-caliber performance that not only well warrants her nomination for Best Actress this year but tops that of her nomination last year for &#65533;Moulin Rouge&#65533;.  Moore (also nominated) is slightly constricted as Laura Brown, her role more or less relegated to either holding back tears or letting them flow.  Streep, whom I adore, doesn&#65533;t really get a chance to showcase her awesome dramatic powers because the role of Clarissa Vaughn leaves her little of an outlet.  This is a woman who has been nominated thirteen times for an Academy Award (and has won twice for 1980&#65533;s &#65533;Kramer Vs. Kramer&#65533; and 1982&#65533;s &#65533;Sophie&#65533;s Choice&#65533;) and it&#65533;s a little disappointing that such incredible talents only receive a small degree of divulgence.  Ed Harris comes off a little inadequate as Richard &#65533; the most memorable aspect of his character is the incredible job the film&#65533;s make-up artists did in rendering an AIDS patient completely emaciated by the disease.  Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Allison Janney, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Dillane round out the supporting cast and Toni Collette, although making a very brief appearance as Brown&#65533;s neighbor Kitty, steals the scene with an affecting portrayal of a woman suppressing profuse heartache.Speaking of make-up, &#65533;The Hours&#65533; contains some subtle but remarkable transformations, most notably Ed Harris&#65533; haggard physique and Kidman&#65533;s transformation into the 40-something reclusive author.  Her prosthetic nose completely changes her physical countenance, rendering the actress nearly unrecognizable, along with her liver-spotted hands and arms.  Moore gets quite a transformation as well, her character showing up once more towards the end with a considerably aged face (60&#65533;s to 70&#65533;s, if I had to guess).Director Stephen Daldry, responsible for 2000&#65533;s cutesy critical fave &#65533;Billy Elliott&#65533;, is at the helm of the picture.  He presents &#65533;The Hours&#65533; in much the same manner as the classic novels of Woolf&#65533;s time &#65533; heavily laced with idyllic sentiment but languorously paced, at times to the point where it can exhaust the patience of more attentive people.  There are even moments where there is too much silence, Philip Glass&#65533;s lovely sonatas completely and utterly absent from the background; this is yet another aspect that can make people start shifting in their seats because the lack of a musical score can mean a failure to evoke a specific mood from its viewers.  Of course, for all I know, this could be Daldry&#65533;s very intention, the silence that all three women keep the very reason for their torment &#65533; we are meant to share their discomfort with the stillness to gain a small understanding of their anxiety.Although &#65533;The Hours&#65533; has a lot going for it (a Pulitzer Prize-winning book, an ensemble cast complete with Golden Globe/Emmy/Oscar winners), it has surprisingly little to flaunt in the end.  Despite the nine nominations it received from the Academy Awards, it is still just a trifle of a film.  If you want to watch a good examination piece, then rent 2000&#65533;s Best Picture winner &#65533;American Beauty&#65533; &#65533; Lester Burnham is the moot prophet of the 21st century.",3.0,0.4444444444444444,1,3,-0.4019,negative,0.9983,very positive,2003,2,23

Robert: Dude we're living Call of Duty... It sucks.WOLVERINES!!!This movie has some heart but if you know anything about military tactics you'll need to suspend disbelief or you just won't enjoy the film. This will likely appeal to some youth who feel they are not doing enough with their lives and want proof that they can when older generations muck up the world.The economy has gotten worse and North Korea has allied with other Asian countries and guess what? They hate America. So they invade a good chunk of the west coast and some kids in a suburb learn guerrilla warfare (in only a few weeks or is it months?) because they're trained by a marine private (played by Chris Hemsworth . .. where are you Patrick Swayze?) and, you know, with enough montages in a film you can become a pro at anything, right?Uhm, WOLVERINES!!!See nerd kids take on veteran soldiers who cannot hit the side of a barn. See Asian soldiers fall for stupid traps. See romance and friendship blossom between kids who run around like dorks (teach some of those actors and actresses to run properly, please). See people sacrifice themselves so that the Wolverines can go on. See the Wolverines get out of a tough jam because, well, they're the heroes.Interesting propaganda about America's greed doing them in and perhaps a nod to the 99% to the 1% but they didn't explore it more which could have been the most interesting idea in this film.That said, it had some heart in certain places and if you can ignore the poor military tactics and coincidences that let the Wolverines prevail, well, you may enjoy it.Duuuuuh, WOLVERINES?Also starring Jeffrey Dean Morgan as one of the grizzled marines.Based on a 1984 film during the height of Cold War paranoia and the fearful belief that America's enemies would invade.

1571869,B008NNY8RC,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,1,2,2012-11-13,IS IT THE JERSEY DEVIL?,"As I started to write this week's column I was going to write about ROCK OF AGES. Then I thought why waste the space on something I didn't like much (although it did make me want to go seek out the music in my collection) when I could write about a small movie that was better? And more qualified for the Halloween season as well.THE BARRENS, as some of you already know, is a wooded area in New Jersey set aside for camping and such. It's also well known for the existence of a creature known as the Jersey Devil. This winged man like creature has supposedly stalked the woods for decades and paranormal investigators have sought it out for years. So it only makes sense that a horror film concern itself with the area.Richard Vineyard (Stephen Moyer) is a father and new husband trying to unite his family. His daughter Sadie is at that age where everything is about rebellion. Tie that in with her rejection of her stepmother Cynthia (Mia Kirshner) feeling she's trying to replace her deceased mother and the son Richard and Cynthia had together, Danny, she's the typical annoying character that you hope learns about reality before the film ends. To bring this family together, Richard has decided that they are going camping in the Barrens, the place where his father took him when he was young.As they prepare for the trip Richard seems distracted, at times even fearful of the trip even though he initiated it. Memories of his childhood in the woods seem to have a haunted moment that he can't quite remember. But the family heads out to the woods for a camping weekend. Along the way, upset that the family can't leave their gadgets behind for just a few days, he tells his wife to put away the cell phone and his daughter to take off the Ipod. This weekend is about nature.The family arrives and sets up camp but its nothing like Richard remembers. Instead of the isolated campground that he recalled there are tons of families here for the weekend. When he finds his daughter flirting with a young man in the campground area, he insists that they move deeper into the woods to be more secluded.As the trip proceeds Richard gets more distracted, breaking out in a sweat and behaving unusual. It isn't until later that the cause is revealed, at least part of it. Is there something physically wrong with Richard? Something mentally disturbing? Or is he truly the victim of the Jersey Devil whose story is told around the campfire one night?It's these questions and watching to find clues for the answer that make this film work so well. You never know if there is something creeping in the woods or if Richard has lost it. As bodies begin to turn up gutted, torn to shreds, you remember Richard playing with his knife and start to consider he's gone mad. Then again perhaps it was this creature that shredded its victims. The final solution to the mystery should satisfy everyone.The movie builds up at a slow pace, increasing the tension as you watch. You not only fear what will happen to those around this family but what will happen to the family itself. Each actor does a wonderful job in the roles given but Moyers stands out as the head of the house that seems to be just tipping over the edge with each scene. Every supporting actor does a great job as well convincingly playing victims of one kind or another.One negative note that can be corrected. Included in the film is an alternate ending. While watching that I felt that it should have been tacked on as well. It would have made the ending of the film better even though it's still got enough surprises to hold your interest until the end.",3.0,0.5,5,1,-0.6597,very negative,-0.5749,negative,2012,11,13

141477,0792838718,A3L3OKIPMLGAUK,2,3,2010-11-02,A Trash Classic,"During the 1980's Cannon Films was the trash can of cinema. Very rarely did they produce any film worthy of praise. Rugged actor extraordinaire Charles Bronson was unquestionably their greatest asset in their acting stable. Brosnon's career was a painfully long time coming. Despite co-starring in Once Upon A Time in a West, The Dirty Dozen, and The Great Escape, all films that are considered down right classics, his career as a leading man didn't materialize until the first Death Wish film. After Death Wish, Bronson generally started getting type casted as one-dimensional men who make their own rules inside and outside the law. 10 to Midnight is no exception and this film stars Bronson and let's face it, people you can't remember because in the Cannon Films library very rarely do you recognize more than one or two names.There really isn't much to analyze in 10 to Midnight because it's pretty simple. Bronson plays a detective named Leo Kessler who is tracking down a serial killer who is knifing girls butt naked. The killer, named Warren Stacy, is played by Gene Davis who does a pretty good job in this film. Davis manages to make the Stacy character as rather twisted and yet pathetic. You certaintly would not rank Waren with Lecter or Kevin Spacey's killer in Se7en but it's harsh to dismiss Stacy out-right. He fits into the cheesy atmosphere.Speaking of cheese, there is no end to it. J. Lee Thompson directed this film and it's a far cry from his early classics like Cape Fear and The Guns of Navarone but he does a good job. He directs Stacy's persuit of his first victim with flair despite the obviously low budget. Of course Stacy's victim is too stupid to run when he finally catches up with her and there's a nice close up Stacy enjoying the sensation of stabbing the woman. One too many times in this film we say ""Don't open that door !"" or ""Run you idiot !"" but it's part of the fun. Thompson knew how to play up the corn and it works and it does stand up even after repeated viewings.Really, I think you could pin-point where this film goes exactly and that is what makes it a fairly bad film but the ride is fun. One of the few times I can say that someone should take it for what is and it dosen't want to be anything else.",3.0,0.6666666666666666,1,2,0.0,neutral,-0.6481,very negative,2010,11,2

However the process of adapting to the new culture after a life spent in Salford, Greater Manchester, proves more difficult for George than it does for his son.  Andy De Emmony's film makes some trenchant points about the difficulties of cultural adaptation, and how it is impossible to 'go back' to one's home culture and expect to live life as one did before emigrating.  There are some very funny moments in this film, especially Sajd as he gradually adjusts himself to alternative ways of life.

He's not given many funny lines but he's great to watch, a poker-faced clown with a strategem, and an uncanny knack at walking right up to loose bulls and getting them to retreat; a great acrobatic performer. By 2011, the stereotyping is so obvious it's a combination history lesson and campy look-back at a quieter, simpler, more controlled society.The English aristocracy is also ensconsed in stereotype - i fact, the movie only works when we watch ""recognisable"" characters in other countries and cultures, as Team Fogg wneds its' way across the globe.The uninitiated might expect alot more ""balloon"" considering that terrific artwork on the VHS jacket! Don't want to give it all away........I saw this picture in 1956 or 1957 with my Father and naturally wanted to watch it again - couldn't remember much that i saw as a 6 year old. But the scene in which Niven and Cantinflas swoop down in the Alps to find something to keep that good booze - undoubtedly ripped off (?) from the gentleman's club where the ""wager"" was made - as chilled as possible!Shirley MacLaine is made up as an ""Indian princess"" rescued from ""sacrifice"" by the two. She does okay but speaks about 5 lines. Mostly does reaction takes.A big problem is that the movie does not know whether it's a respectable tribute to Jules Verne or a Hollywood party reel - fun to see dozens of major stars of the day all over the map in happy little cameos but it leaves the viewer a bit edgy...is this really literature translated for the screen?Another guarantee - like the Jules Verne guarantee of a fun story - is a miraculous soundtrack - thanks to Victor Young.VHS quality, well, go for the DVD, although, in all fairness, I borrowed a Library copy.",3.0,0.6666666666666666,2,1,0.0,neutral,0.9961,very positive,2011,6,4

Perhaps the Director deliberately makes the pace slower to depict the nature of Maine.  Wilkinson (a doctor) and Spacek (music director) are one of those good doers family with a son (studying to be an architect) heading back for summer.  Stahl (the son) is involved with a single mother of two in the form of Tomei.  Her previous marriage with the ex-husband (separated but not divorced) is estranged and that causes tension between the three parties that are involved.  Then, everything comes to a blow and tragedy strikes.  Akin to Mystic River, whilst everybody is adjusting to the tragedy and yearn to move on with their lives, underneath the tranquility, there's a boiling rage to avenge, an eye for an eye.  In one of the scenes, whilst playing poker with friends, one of them commented that it's the quiet one that's lethal.  That statement resonates through the rest of the movie.  Whilst some are pointing fingers and this person and that, whilst some are at loss for words and wondered why something like this would have happened, some are plotting to do what they deem is necessary to square off things.  Once again, we are led to yet another unexpected and tragic ending.  I have to say that I'm emotionally drained after the movie.  If you are looking for a deep and thought provoking movie, this is the one for you.  It doesn't get five Oscar nominations for no reasons.

So, I was anxious to see what the film version would be like. While I appreciate Julie Taymor's rather 'artsy' take on the story, the most powerful scenes are those that are played straight without all the anachronistic elements and overblown costumes and sets.  Jessica Lange and Anthony Hopkins are perfectly cast, and give great performances. The final 'banquet' scene with the pie still has a grotesque element of humor (onstage the same scene had the audience laughing out loud). Also, getting inside of Titus' madness came across better in film - particularly his encounter with &quot;Revenge&quot; (although this scene still plays rather silly no matter how it is staged).

479319,6305808171,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,9,11,2004-04-09,Joan Fontaine and the Coven of the Kooky,"In her last appearance on the silver screen, Joan Fontaine, who won an Academy Award for her performance in Suspicion (1941), stars in this Hammer Studios release of The Witches (1967).  While the material here is certainly not of the caliber of some of the previous films she's appeared in, it is fun to watch.  Maybe I have some lurid fascination of seeing once great stars reduced to appearing in roles they probably would have never considered in their prime.Joan plays Gwen Mayfield, a teacher who has just been accepted to assume a position as head teacher of a private school in a small English village.  The film starts off with Gwen teaching at a mission school in Africa, and, after an incident with a native witch doctor that caused Gwen to have a nervous breakdown, she has now returned to England to put the pieces of her life back together.After formally meeting with her employers, Alan and Stephanie Bax, played by Alec McCowen and Kay Walsh respectively, the well-to-do resident benefactors of the town who are also brother and sister, Gwen settles into her new surroundings.  The situation seems idyllic, a nice, quiet position in a small town where little happens, but, as the saying goes, still waters sometimes run deep.  The oddness begins when two of her pre-teen students, a boy and a very weird girl, exhibit closeness to each other, one borne of a budding romance.  This causes consternation among some of the townspeople, and soon the boy falls ill of a mysterious coma.  Apparently there was more than just a passing concern about what might happen if the relationship between these two continued, specifically in respect to the girl.Rumors of witchery begin to reach Gwen, and the deeper she probes, the more ominous the proceedings.  As the notion of witchery becomes more and more viable, the idea that there may be more than one witch, a coven, operating within the town, involving various members of the small village.  Gwen soon finds herself at odds with unseen forces, and suffers a relapse, forcing her to be institutionalized.  She has also lost her memory of everything that's transpired after leaving Africa.  She does regain her memory, bits at a time, and the horror begins to return as she understands what is about to transpire, and rushes back to the town in an attempt to save the girl from an unknown fate, and ultimately learn that witchery is not limited to third world peoples but is alive and well here in this small, English village.Joan Fontaine does a great job here, still exhibiting the sheen of a Hollywood star, even if some of that sheen has dulled since her prime.  I have to say, even pushing 50 she still looked pretty good, despite the oddish, bowl bouffant she sported through most of the film.  Fontaine's older sister, Olivia de Havilland, didn't fare as well, career wise, in my opinion, starring in dubious films like Lady in a Cage (1964), and Irwin Allen 70's disaster pics like Airport '77 (1977) and The Swarm (1978).  The creepy factor develops nicely as the film progresses, and as the mystery deepens about who's involved in the coven and what their purpose is, but this is soon replaced by a goofy factor as we see the coven in action, performing a ritual, half-nekkid dance of sorts in a decrepit, abandoned church, eating greasy dirt as their leader spouts incomprehensible mumbo-jumbo while clad in colorful robes and donning a crown with birthday candles adorning the top.  I kept waiting for someone to make a wish and blow out the candles, but the others were to busy bumping and grinding to their chanting, and, as I said before, masticating the mud.Anchor Bay Entertainment releases a great print, in wide screen anamorphic format.  Special features include a theatrical trailer, television promotional spots and a World of Hammer episode titled Wicked Women.  Also included in the DVD case on the flipside of the card listing the chapter stops is a reproduction of promotional material used for the film.  I really find much enjoyment in these little touches, as it seems to indicate thought was actually put into the release, and a sense that one's getting their money's worth, even though this release seems a bit pricey.Cookieman108",3.0,0.8181818181818182,3,1,0.0,neutral,0.9922,very positive,2004,4,9

Much of this probably has to do with Cameron Diaz, who is just such a likable actress. She's a beautiful woman with a knockout figure and a mega-watt smile, and yet she's so goofy and willing to make fun of herself that even when she's playing nasty characters it's hard not to find her charming.And boy is this character nasty. She's greedy, she's lazy, and she's selfish. She lies, she steals, she manipulates. What's also interesting is that the storyline of the repugnant central character, Elizabeth, does not fall into either of the two clich&eacute;s that you'd expect from a Hollywood film:1) She does not end up finding herself inspired by the children and discover a love of teaching, revealing a heart of gold hidden beneath her prickly exterior.2) She does not find herself getting her comeuppance for being such an awful human being.If anything, the characters in the film who are depicted as truly pathetic are Elizabeth's sincere, hardworking fellow teachers.

844467,B0002S93TO,AB34G6VKP28L,1,1,2012-03-22,Dishonest But Entertaining,"Ancient Rome was a model for civilization that cultures have followed ever since. It was also entirely brutal and pagan, but when the Roman Empire took over much of the world, it allowed Christianity to spread through a common speech. Seventy years before a significant baby was born in a manger, Julius Caesar became one of Rome's most influential figures and fought his way into the history books.The law of Rome states that an army cannot march into the confines of the city. But the law means nothing to those with power. Lucius Sulla (Richard Harris) has just taken over the empire, marching his men into the senate and black listing all those who have opposed him in the past. Thousands are fleeing his heavy-handed regime, among them the father in law of Julius Caesar (Jeremy Sisto). In an attempt to save the man's life, Caesar is captured by Sulla's armies and imprisoned. Having heard of his legacy, Sulla has him brought in for trial. Liking the young man's impertinence, Sulla offers him the opportunity to live, if he will but divorce his ""tainted"" wife. Too passionately in love with his beloved to consider such a thing, Caesar adamantly refuses. Impressed by his frank adoration, Sulla allows him to go free, but then tells his general Pompey (Christopher North) to have Caesar assassinated in the morning.Instead of carrying through his command, Pompey gives his signet ring to the young man and tells him to flee the province. Caesar does as he is told, and returns several years after Sulla's sudden death. Pompey is now the voice of reason and force in Rome, much to the disappointment of the senators, among them Marcus Cato (Christopher Walken) and other ""men of the common wealth."" Rome's empire is threatened from all sides and Pompey, now Consul, takes an army to victory on the battlefield. Returning bathed in glory, his romantic eye falls on Julia (Nicole Grimaudo), Caesar's beloved and beautiful daughter. Their friendship has grown strong in the passing years, and he is not opposed to the marriage, but desires to accumulate something from it. Wanting to prove himself in battle and earn honor through victory, Caesar allows Julia to be married to Pompey in exchange for the use of his armies in Gaul, where a revolution has been sparked.While Caesar's name flows from every mouth in the empire, the senators are growing uneasy, knowing that he could easily overtake Rome and become the next dictator. Ultimately through loss, love, and triumph, Caesar will be turned against his dearest friend, betray his wife with a beautiful Egyptian temptress, and have his blood shed on the pages of history. This miniseries does an ample job of covering numerous years in the general's life. My only true complaint is that sometimes it can be confusing, since there's no direct implication of time passing, only mention of it in dialogue. One minute, Caesar is a bright-eyed youth, the next his hair is gray. It could have used a little polishing, but overall the production is very worthwhile, particularly if you want a crash course in Ancient History. It revolves around Caesar, which means that time spent with significant other individuals in the time period, such as Marc Anthony and Cleopatra, is limited, and leaves the audience hungering for something more.I found this production highly entertaining, very informative about the era, and generally acceptable, if sometimes very rushed. I would have liked more character development in his relationship with Cleopatra and the social implications that followed. But as it stands, Julius Caesar is an interesting glimpse into a bygone society.",3.0,1.0,1,1,0.3612,positive,0.9979,very positive,2012,3,22

Here's my rundown of the top bouts that occured at the event. Keep in mind: I rate at a bust of five stars (*****).1. World Heavyweight Championship:Triple H [c] vs. Chris Benoit vs. Shawn Michaels*****-Incredible match. Jaw-dropping spots and excellent mat wrestling give this match a nod for M.O.T.Y. (Match of the Year). This match combined all the elements that make pro wrestling great: an electric crowd, 3 technically savvy workers putting on a tremendous show, and the crowning of a new (and deserving) World Heavyweight Champion.2. WWE Championship:Eddie Guerrero [c] vs. Kurt Angle****1/2-Another great bout. The mat work was superior to the triple-threat, but the World Heavyweight Championship made up for that flaw with lots and lots of blood that fueled the intense flow of the match. The reason this one doesn't get a perfect rating was the somewhat 'weak' looking finish. It wasn't that bad. ...3. Two on Three Handicap Match:The Rock and Sock Connection vs. Evolution****-Highly entertaining match. The Rock and Ric Flair put on a great show with little spots here and there. Foley and Orton looked suprisingly good (considering that Foley hasn't wrestled in four years). Batista seemed out of place. However, all five participants succeeded in providing a nice match to set up a Foley/Orton match down the line. The ending was beautiful and very spotaneous.4. Chris Jericho vs. Christian***1/2-Nice match, the spots were well planned and the technical wrestling was off-the-page enthralling. The butterfly suplex spot was especially cool to see. The plot twist (in the Jericho/Trish storyline) at the end further cemented Jericho into a babyface role.Well, that's the end....of the good matches. The rest were either mediocre or below-average.

This film is certainly more tailor-made for Lane, since she dominated most of the movie, and she's good, even if not as good as her previous career revival roles in Unfaithful and Under The Tuscan Sun. John Cusack is a bit underexposed and miscast for his part, and he's been far more enjoyable to watch in movies like High Fidelity or Bullets Over Broadway.Sarah(Lane) is divorced pre-school teacher and she's been encouraged by her family to get out and start dating again. She reluctantly goes on dates with men whom responded to an internet ad that was posted by her sister(Elizabeth Perkins). She had to go through a string of aweful first dates before meeting her ideal soulmate(Jake/John Cusack), who happened to be on the mend from an unpleasant divorce. He's the only guy that she went beyond the first date, but she's not ready to open herself emotionally. It was very funny to see them on the second date together when they had to drive all over town to buy condoms.  Meanwhile, she's got another potential boyfriend(Bob/Dermot Mulroney) trying to enter her life. Bob is a single ""hot dad"" whose kid happens to be Sarah's student, and they are obviously attracted to each other.Sarah's Dad(Christopher Plummer) also goes on serial dating women he met on-line. (Dolly)Stockard Channing is the one that truly fell for him, despite the fact that he's not serious about falling in love again after his departed wife. Channing stole scenes with her comic moments, especially in the scenes when she showed Sarah her ads on various websites and when a teenage guy came to see her after corresponding on line.Sarah eventually learned to let herself go and be brave and went on as many dates as she could. She soon realized that Bob was just taking an advantage of her sexually and didn't take her seriously like Jake did, but she had turned Jake away when he saw her with Bob. Can ""Dog Park Girl"" find her way back into the arms of ""Condom Man"" before he loses his good intension and go for other girls?Overall, this film is pretty funny and so-so romantic ,and it's got lots of chick-flick cliche jokes that will work for the female crowds.

Unlike many of the WCW videos from the late 1990s, this tape does not only focus on a single year (it spans from 1996 to 1999).  On this tape you will see the exciting origins and pitiful continuation of the storyline.Things kick off with Hogan's famous heel turn at Bash at the Beach 96.  This is considered one of the greatest moments in 1990s wrestling.  Watch the crowd as they are disgusted and throw garbage into the ring.  People were shocked, but the WCW stuck with it.  Also covered is the nWo / 4 Horsemen feud.  The Horsemen had previously been the ""bad boys"" of wrestling, but here they represented tradition.  This angle was controversial amongst some fans due to the fact that the nWo parody of Arn Anderson's retirement was considered disrespectful (Arn didn't know about it at all).  Also, it has been said that the door of the cage at Fall Brawl 97 was not properly outfitted and that Curt Hennig really did slam it on Ric Flair's head.  Also covered are the hugely successful Starrcade 97 and the beginnings of the split within the nWo.  Even avid nWo fans now believe that this was the beginning of the end, as at one point there were more wrestlers in the nWo than there were in WCW proper.  Watch the crowd when the nWo factions ""reunite"" at on Monday Nitro- instead of jubilation or anger like we saw at Bash at the Beach years earlier, we see an audience who is largely unsurprised and unimpressed.Many of the matches are heavily edited so as to make the tape more of a ""story"".  This is a shame as some of these matches (such as the Uncensored 98 match) were actually cool.  Also the clip of Goldberg being attacked by the nWo is edited into the story almost half a year before it took place chronologically.  Interspersed throughout the video are many of the black and white promos done for the nWo, including the ""Souled Out"" clip with Bischoff as a great orator.  There is a ""Wolfpack"" promo too.  ""Hollywood"" Hogan, Buff Bagwell, Scott Steiner, ""Big Sexy"" Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, Lex Luger and Curt Hennig all make little statements here and there.  During the closing credits, there is a montage of nWo members saying ""for life"" where even Vincent the bodyguard makes an appearance.On this tape there is some occasional narraration from Eric Bischoff.  Bischoff was of course responsible for a lot of what was going on in WCW at the time, including a lot of the ridiculous attempts to ""crossover"" into mainstream/non-wrestling media.  Some of these worked in that they drew high ratings for the company, but they also infuriated longtime fans who considered these angles cheap and pointless.  Some of the quotes on this tape ""prove"" that Bischoff got too out of touch with the lifelong wrestling fans.  While talking about Diamond Dallas Page's efforts to find a tag partner to beat the nWo, Bischoff points out that ""even Karl Malone and Jay Leno were powerless"".  Nevertheless we must give the man his due, as he was a major force in building a lot of renewed interest in World Championship Wrestling.some of the matches featured on this video:Bash at the Beach 96the Outsiders (Kevin Nash and Scott Hall) and ""special guest"" vs. Lex Luger, Macho Man and StingUncensored 97WCW team (the Giant, Jeff Jarrett and Scott Steiner) vs. Piper team (Roddy Piper, Chris Benoit and Steve ""Mongo"" McMichael) vs nWo team (Macho Man, Hollywood Hogan and Scott Hall)Fall Brawl 974 Horsemen (Ric Flair, Chris Benoit, ""Mongo"" and Curt Hennig)vs. Team nWo (Kevin Nash, Syxx, Buff Bagwell and Konnan)Starrcade 97Hollywood Hogan vs. Stingappearance by Bret Hartbrief clip:Spring Stampede 98Kevin Nash vs. StingUncensored 98""Macho Man"" Randy Savage vs. Hollywood Hoganinterference by the Disciple and StingWCW Thunder - March 26, 1998, Monday Nitro - April 20, 1998Hollywood Hogan / Kevin Nash feud buildupMonday Nitro - July 6, 1998Scott Hall vs. GoldbergHollywood Hogan vs. Goldberg (for Heavyweight Title)interference from Curt Hennig and Karl Malonebrief clip: Monday Nitro - January 4, 1999nWo mob on GoldbergBash at the Beach 98Hollywood Hogan and Dennis Rodman vs. Karl Malone and Diamond Dallas Pageinterference from the DiscipleRoad Wild 98Hollywood Hogan and Eric Bischoff vs. Diamond Dallas Page and Jay Lenointerference from Kevin EubanksMonday Nitro - June 29, 1998, December 7, 1998random publicity stunt madnessMonday Nitro - January 4, 1999Kevin Nash vs. Hollywood Hogan (for Heavyweight Title)*fingerpoke of Doom*Thunder - January 11, 1999nWo reunion clipI'll admit when I first watched this tape years ago, I thought it was stupid an poorly done.

Of late, comedies have been more and more gross, thanks mainly to the sickening trend set by movies like 'There is something about Mary'.  Woody Allen deserves credit for giving us 'Hollywood ending', a film that has some very funny moments.Woody Allen plays a washed-out film director, whose wife (played by Tea Leoni) has left him for a film producer (Treat Williams).  Then this script comes into the hands of Treat Williams and his film company ('Galaxie films') and Tea Leoni thinks that Allen will be the best choice to direct it.  She convinces Williams and his friends and then the laugh riot starts!  Allen meets his ex-wife and the decision makers of Galaxie films and seals the deal (with some very funny scenes!).  Come the first day of shooting and Woody Allen becomes blind (psychosomatic blindness).  The rest of the story revolves around how he (with Tea Leoni's help) keeps his blindness a secret from everyone else and manages to direct the film.Woody Allen is very very funny and steals many a scene, with the best one being the one in which he meets Tea Leoni at a restaurant after he lands the directing job.  Leoni supports him very well and Debra Messing ('Will and Grace') plays Allen's new (and not so bright) girlfriend.  All the supporting actors are good, with the Chinese cameraman and his translator being the pick of the lot.Needless to say, the film directed by the blind Woody Allen gets horrible reviews initially, but then there is a twist in the climax that justifies the title - 'Hollywood ending'.  The funny moments keep the film up and running and in the end, this is surely worth watching at least once.",3.0,0.8888888888888888,1,1,0.4927,positive,0.9878,very positive,2002,5,1

Today, Jon is set to be executed for his crimes.Jack not only has his own psychiatric firm, but he also teaches at the University of Washington in Seattle.  He wakes up this morning to learn that one of his students was killed exactly the say way that Jon killed women.Then he receives the phone call.  ""You have 88 minutes to live.  At 11:45, you will die.""  At first he considers it a crank, but the more the person calls back, the more he takes it seriously.  Is Jon guilty?  Who murdered his student?  And who is going to kill him?I was attracted to this film because of the ticking clock premise.  I am a sucker for those kind of stories, I guess.  And as a thriller, it worked.  I spent plenty of time cringing waiting for the next big event to come, hoping it wouldn't scare me.I thought I had the villain pin pointed early on, but turned out to be wrong.  Once I figured that out, I did pick up on the true villain earlier then I would have liked and spent the rest of the movie waiting for Jack to catch up.Which brings me to the main problem with the film; it was predictable.  And for a thriller, that's never a good thing.  And it didn't help that the previews gave away way too much.And I can't forget the slow start.  Yes, we needed the information.  But it could have been given to us once the story got started.  As it was, I was almost bored before the prologue ended and the action began.Additionally, the characters were rather flat.  We're talking one dimensional at best.  Heck, I never even connected with Jack.  The only reason he got my sympathy was because I was afraid I'd jump during those tense scenes.As a side note, do that that R rating seriously.  The images of the murders are rather graphic.  I had to look away a few times.Despite all the negatives, this thriller is mildly entertaining.  See it if you must.

Horror of Dracula and Dracula Prince of Darkness are undeniably, in my opinion,  Hammer Studios two greatest achievements...bar none!Dracula Has Risen From the Grave, though not quite as good as the previous two films, is certainly worth watching.  It deals with a young man and woman in love; a doting mother; and her brother the priest, who is concerned about his niece's spiritual well being and safety, as her boyfriend is a self proclaimed Atheist.  In this movie Dracula has defiled the town parish with the murder of a young village woman in God's House...and has found a new minion in a young priest, who has lost his faith and turned to drink.  Though he (the young priest) wants to break free of Dracula, he cannot and unwillingly seeks out new victims for the Prince of Darkness.  Anything in between or at the end of this movie you can discover for yourselves!Taste the Blood of Dracula centers around three older gentlemen who are living a life of debauchery, but even those pleasures are not enough to satisfy their needs.  In hopes of discovering new pleasures they enlist the aid of a young aristocrat, who is heavy into the occult and promises them pleasures beyond compare...but first requires each man to drink the rehydrated blood of Count Dracula.  In the course of events they kill the man, and Dracula seeks vengeance against those who killed his servant.Dracula A.D. 1972 is the world of Vampires meets the mod squad pitting the heir Laurence Van Helsing and his Grand Daughter Jessica against Count Dracula.

584646,B00005JKC3,A1QRXEM0WSLGT5,2,6,2012-06-01,Stick with Dramas Ang Lee!!!!,"----------------------------------------Public service announcement before I begin review.  Toonami is back!!!  Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.----------------------------------------I remember seeing this over 9 years ago.  At the time I thought it was a good film.  But...as we age and our tastes get refined, we start knowing better.  Also the one flaw this movie has is that it DOESN'T FOLLOW THE SOURCE MATERIAL, I.E. THE COMIC BOOKS!!!  That's a big deal.Also the acting by Eric Bana was really unimpressive.  Nick Nolte, well he's Nick Nolte, looking as if he was fresh out of prison in this movie, crazy hair and all.  Jennifer Connelly while good in other films, felt out of place in this one.  The only actor I actually think gave a GOOD performance was the great Sam Elliot, as General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross.***Major Difference in this Hulk and the Comic Book Hulk***If you are a comic book reader or if you have at least heard of 'The Hulk' you know that Bruce Banner gets exposed to gamma radiation.  In the comics it's a bomb explosion he's exposed to.  In the tv series and the 'Incredible Hulk' movie and 'Avengers' movie, he's exposed to gamma radiation in that weird looking rotating chair.  Still, simple concept, radiation exposure = Hulk.  Sure, there are other factors, Bruce was beaten as a child by a drunk father and this is why he's angry as the Hulk, etc.  Still over all, a good simple concept that has worked since the 1960's.Enter Ang Lee, a director who wants to take this beloved character in another direction.  Ang envisions a 30 foot Hulk, who is the way he is for other complicated reasons.  Well...here it goes.***Movie/Plot Details, Spoiler Alert, But I would not worry about it...***David Banner (Nick Nolte) when he was younger worked as an Army scientist whose passion was to make people stronger and resistant to diseases.  The beginning of the movie shows him dissecting a jelly-fish, a salmonder, a sea cucumber, a star-fish, and other creatures and collecting their genetic material.  After numerous experiments he successfully implants these various genes into a spider-monkey and after gasing the poor thing with cyonide, it survives.  He realizes then that he has strengthened the monkey's cellular structure and made it a stronger organism.He of course goes to Thaddeus Ross and demands to start human test subjects.  Ross of course says NO, and thus David Banner must resort to other measures.  He begins to test on himself.  He soon discovers that he may have modified himself genetically, but isn't quite sure of the results.  He then is informed by his wife that she is pregnant and they are going to have a child.  Little Bruce is born 9 months later.David soon discovers that the genes he has spliced into himself were passed on to his child.  Notice the green tinge of color on the baby's arms and legs when his pacifer is yanked away... David is horrified and wants to find a cure for this accident.  Ross however explores Banner's lab and finds out he has broken protocal and has been doing human testing.  Ross tells Banner he is finished.  David seems to suffer a mental break-down and causes the Army base's gamma nuclear power plant to overload and explode.  He then heads home to stab Bruce with a kitchen knife, but Bruce's mother fights and gets stabbed and killed herself.  Little Bruce witnesses all of this, and this is eluded to as the reason he is so violent as the Hulk.Long story short David Banner is taken away, little Bruce is put into foster care and grows up with all his young life repressed in his mind.This is where the movie really takes a weird turn.  It seems the now Dr. Bruce Banner is working on ""Nanomeds"", nano machines that can repair a person once they are inside one's body.  He and Dr. Betty Ross are testing these machines on frogs.  They bombard a frog with gamma radiation, expose it to the nanomeds and hope the frog gets healed by the little molecule machines.  Unfortunately so far all that's happened is the frogs explode.An unfortunate accident happens one day in the lab.  A lab assistant is caught in the lab, Bruce comes in to get him free of the equipment.  For some reason the gamma emitters come on full blast, and the nanomeds get released.  Bruce ingests the nanomeds and gets a whallop of gamma radiation.He wakes up in the hospital seemingly okay, apparently the nanomeds saved him.I'll simply say he's not, and after a visit from his long lost father (Nick Nolte) discovers he does indeed have some weird genes in his dna.So, how exactly/why does he become the Hulk in this movie.  Here it goes.  Bruce inheritated these extra genes from his father.  By the process of them getting passed on, they are purified and integrated better into his genome than his father's.  But the genes are recessive.  They are not dominant genes.  They are sort of just hanging out in his dna, and for quite a while not doing anything.  He grows up, and gets exposed to the gamma radiation.  The gamma apparently ""unlocks"" these genes and allows them to become dominant, with the ability to be expressed.  Still his normal human genes are still the most prominant though.  But he now has nano machines swimming around inside of his body.  These machines respond to injury.  When Bruce gets angry, the nano machines interpret anger as ""injury"".  But since he has nothing physical to heal, they instead, (for an unexplained reason), restructure him based off his newly expressable artificial genes his father gave him.  I.E. he transforms into the Hulk when angered.Whew...that's a mouthful.  This the reason this movie is not very good.  That and the Hulk is at his biggest, yes he changes size for some reason, 30 feet tall.  Add to it the weird character of Nick Nolte and the fact he becomes the Absorbing Man and you have one big stinker.Are the action scenes good.  Absolutely, they are in fact the only saving grace of this movie, that and Sam Elliot.I could go more into the story, but there's no point.  This particular incarnation of the Hulk has been abandoned.  The Hulk from the 'Avengers' is official Hulk now, and quite cool I might add.  Marvel had the right idea by scrapping 'The Hulk' and starting over with the 'Incredible Hulk'.  It was a far better movie, and is part of the 'Iron-Man', 'Thor', 'Captain America', and 'Avengers' franchise now.---In Conclusion---This movie is a prime example of what happens when you mess with something that is not broken.  All I can say is I'm finally glad the movie studios are listening to the comic-book fanboys and delivering movies that are GOOD and stay true, mostly, to the source material.  Not only does it make for better movies, and box office success, but it keeps the comic book geeks, (like me), happy.  And they should strive to keep us happy, we can make or break a superhero movie's success...Is it worth buying.  Only if you can find it cheap, like 8 bucks and below.  Otherwise just wait for it to come on tv somewhere.  It's showing on the Encore channels right now.  You could just catch it there.Well that's my thoughts.  Hopefully the days of a film like this are over and all we will be getting from this point on is 'Avengers' quality movies.  Here's hoping, and here's hoping that the new 'Man of Steel' movie doesn't suck.  Kevin Costner as Johnathen Kent, it may just have a chance...",3.0,0.3333333333333333,1,2,0.0,neutral,0.9721,very positive,2012,6,1
933159,B000ATQYQU,A2D9TA1EYXA9KR,12,21,2006-02-05,A trip down the sewer of life.  Beautifully realized.,"Inner demons being what they are, and seeing how they are inextricably bound to the drive to create art - something outside oneself - it was only a matter of time until we had a movie about the devastation that child abuse brings into the lives of children.This movie is horrible to watch, because it does not shrink from the pain of pulling off an unhealed scab.  This movie is beautifully done for the same reason.From the arrogant, abusive, self loathing of Neil (Joseph Gorfon Levitt), a teenage gay prostitute, his emotionally self-involved mother (Elizabeth Shue), the UFO obsessed Brian (Brady Corbett), every single role in this film is superbly acted and nuanced.This film is awful in content, truthful in the telling, raw in story, and given a light hand in directing that makes you feel you are there.  The aspect of the plot that gets repeated, a point that is for others to discuss is that it implys that child molestation is sexually gratifying and pleasant for the child.  That implication creates an unspoken complicity of the child that I don't think any society wants to delve into, and I'm not sure it is even a good directoral choice for this film.  It muddies the message.Still, the message is unmistakable, that these characters will absolutely never recover from what was done to them as children.  It is too bad that in all these years of filmmaking, we have never been able to get a filmmaker to make a similar message regarding the rape of women.  I've actually had filmmakers say that rape is irrelevant to character, a plot device and nothing else.I can not give this movie 5 stars, because one of the qualities of a great film to me is that it is entertaining.  This isn't.  It isn't even cathartic.  It is fantastically realized, but it is predominantly a trip down the sewer with (Neil) someone you don't like and can not trust.  You feel sorry for him, but no real solution is forthcoming.  It is real... but then, is that really what anyone wants in a movie?  No wonder movie theatres are dying.It goes down to 3 stars because I can not unreservedly recommend this film.  I will be surprised if I ever recommend this film to more than 3 people in my life.  So ultimately, it means that this incredible talent of storytelling, acting, directing, and all other aspects of this film are wasted on something that may only be viewed by the artsy intelligencia, and voting members of the Academy of Motion Pictures.  What a waste.  A really fantastically well done, truly ""horrible"" film.",3.0,0.5714285714285714,3,3,0.5719,positive,-0.9584,very negative,2006,2,5

Despite being made on a shoe-string budget and featuring unknown actors, ""Poison"" still manages to be a visually innovative, provocative and intelligent film. The film is made up of three seperate stories interwoven together. In ""Hero"", which takes place in the early 80's and is filmed in documentary style, a young boy kills his father, and the community tries to figure out why. In ""Horror"", which looks like a campy old black and white horror film, a scientist manages to turn the human sex drive into a serem, and then becomes a sexually predatory leper when he accidently drinks it. In ""Homo"", a man in prison in the early 20th century becomes obsessed with a fellow inmate who he watched being abused years before in a reformatory. Initially, the stories seem to have nothing in common, but the more the film goes on you start to see the connection ... they all focus on the darker side of human sexuality, and its consequences.

The story is farfetched, but manages to work as a comedy.  Knoxville's uncle (Cox), has run into trouble with his bookie.  Knoxville, hoping to be a good Samaritan, hired the janitor he was told to fire as the lawnkeeper at his apartment complex.  He lies to the janitor and tells him that he'll have insurance.  Of course, the man cuts off two of his fingers and Knoxville takes him to the hospital.  Without any real insurance, Knoxville has to come up with the money to pay for the surgery to re-attach his friend's fingers.  He and Cox come up with a plan to rig the Special Olympics and bet against star Olympian Jimmy to win the games.  It sounds flawless, right?Knoxville doesn't expect some of these athletes to be as good as they actually are.  They figure him out as a fake but use him to their advantage against the cocky Jimmy.  Knoxville also falls for one of the volunteers at the game (Heigl), and has to figure out how he can reveal the truth behind her boyfriend AND convince her to fall for him instead.Great care is taken to avoid any slighting or insults of the Olympians.  Some of the characters are played by actors without disabilities, especially a couple of the key athletes.  The rest of the cast does a brilliant job and are actually funnier than Knoxville.The Farrelly brothers produced ""The Ringer,"" but it lacks a lot of the bite that you find in other films that they've had a hand in such as ""Stuck On You"" and ""Something About Mary.""

704179,B0000687F5,A3DM6UGX44NJ9K,18,27,2003-05-26,Shocking Swordplay,"Feudal Japan--Leaders of the Shinsengumi militia, an indpendent ""bad cop"" faction on the government's side, watch as their two newest recruits face off in a Kendo match--a wooden sword battle during a time when swordmasters received the highest regard, the samurai period. Bearded Tashiro faces off against Sozaburo Kano, who everyone can see is easily the better swordsman. But to the surprise of many, except a few insightful higher-ups, Kano loses. Beat Takeshi's Hijikata character (one of many real Japanese personalities--the Shinsengumi stories alone could entertain you for hours) and Isami Kondo immediately understand, what is going on. The viewer doesn't, but soon will. A thoughtful, judgemental look at Sozaburo, with his boyish face and demeanor, long, smooth hair, and feminine almond-shaped eyes--got it yet?--reveals all. He lost because he may be ""involved"" with Tashiro, who may not be the only one with ""leanings"" toward Sozaburo.It's an interesting revelation to those of us only familiar with the tough samurais of Kurosawa films or the Zatoichi blind swordsman-type TV series; that these men of the sword were also men of a different type of sword. The practice isn't uncommon in history. Gladiators (yes, those during Russell Crowe's Maximus character's time) were also prone to have homosexual leanings, as did many senators. But director Nagisa Oshima does a masterful job of the consequences of a workplace relationship in the context of samurai Japan, and a homosexual relationship at that.Not to say that the practice is widely accepted. Hijikata even orders a sergeant to take Sozaburo to a brothel to see if he can be turned around; Sozaburo misinterprets the sergeant's friendliness. Internal strife develops as other samurais join the chase for Sozaburo; rumor gives birth to tension that ends in murders, a difficult thing to have in an organization involved in a war. This is particularly of concern to Hijikata, who serves as the narrative voice in many parts of the movie, although Sozaburo remains the protagonist.Oshima has a flair for creating then sustaining moods, be it soft, dark and suspenseful, or symbolically poignant. The swordfights are excellent, as they should be, being that this is a samurai film. Blood and gore levels are kept a reasonably tame level for this sort of film. This film would be best viewed with some sort of knowledge of the time period; perhaps get some simple reading done, or even watch a few episodes of the Rurouni Kenshin anime series, which deals heavily with the Shinsengumi, Ishin Shishi and the Meiji restoration of this time (search for ""Samurai X"" then watch the Trust and Betrayal movies).This is a four-star film that gets three for revealing an aspect of the samurai that many hardcore fans may not be comfortable with. It may taint your ideal of the samurai, but Oshima allows us to accept this slowly, through a beautifully--both in image and in flow--worked film. Highly recommended for viewing, and possibly recommended for your own library.",3.0,0.6666666666666666,1,1,-0.4019,negative,0.9198,very positive,2003,5,26
406427,6304184689,A2OP21WUY8L3WL,4,5,2004-12-23,Pay attention to what you order.,"A reviewer brings up a good point in making us aware that the information listed for the video on this page is for the Joel M. Reed 'Night of the Zombies' and not the Bruno Mattei/Vincent Dawn 'Night of the Zombies'. He misses the point that the reason everybody else has reviewed the Bruno Mattei 'Night of the Zombies' on this page is because that is what they got when they ordered a copy. This is the only listing for 'Night of the Zombies' and the Bruno Mattei film is more common and popular than the Joel M. Reed Film. If you look in the used and new section you will find both movies. You need to examine the listing carefully to make certain which movie you are ordering. Unfortunately when two movies have the same name, this causes quite a bit of confusion in the listing, especially when both movies are obviously the same subject; and it does not help that they share the same release year (although I believe the Reed film was made several years before it found a release and a place on Elvira's show). Reed's film is about Nazi zombies (not to be confused with 'Oasis of the Zombies') who apparently have nothing better to do than battle each other (while plotting to take over the world?) while being investigated by an ex-porn star playing a CIA man. Mattei's film is about Interpol commandos on the island of New Ginuea who end up babysitting a reporter and cameraman while fighting zombies on their way to the Hope Center, a synthetic nourishment plant, where a freak accident started this situation. I would rate Mattei's film at 3 stars just for its entertainment value and Reed's film at two stars for its lack of the same, but it is a good movie to poke fun at (why do you think Elvira ran it). Reed's film is low on the gore scale and Mattei's film is high on the gore and repulsion scale. By the way, if the name Joel M.

Upon closely examining Coraline's storyline however, one can find a rather poorly developed villain and numerous plot devices that give the young adventurer far too much help, consequently reducing the severity and intensity of her trials.  But at least everything looks fantastic.Having just moved to the eerily isolated Pink Palace Apartments, and being consistently ignored by her parents, Coraline (Dakota Fanning) finds herself terribly bored.  But all that changes when she discovers a mysterious hidden doorway that leads to an alternate world - one that parallels her own but seems much better.  In this other reality Coraline finds what she believes she's always wanted, but she soon learns just how deceptive appearances can be...At first her visits to the other world seem like dreams - she has a more loving, playful mother, an exciting father who actually likes gardening (something Coraline enjoys) and amazing food, instead of the goop she's usually served. Even the eccentric next-door circus ringleader Mr. Bobinsky is more jubilant and the dramatic theater-loving neighbors Miss Spink and Miss Forcible are entertaining. While every ""Other"" character has improved, each one has buttons instead of eyes. And the catch becomes apparent when the Other Mother insists that Coraline adopt button eyes of her own.It's darker and more sinister than Henry Selick's previous stop-motion films James and the Giant Peach and The Nightmare Before Christmas, but has familiar elements from the visionary mind of Neil Gaiman. It's like a darker, twisted version of Alice in Wonderland, complete with a talking cat. The atmosphere is splendidly enchanting, the environment is unique and the visuals are top-notch. The animation is also seamlessly blended between puppets, extravagant sets and computer graphics. The pacing, however, is a little slow and the production as a whole doesn't succeed as a family film (or even a children's movie) due to its unnerving plot.  And while our heroine receives plenty of attention, the villain's backstory is mysteriously absent, leaving one wondering the point of orchestrating such an elaborate facade.Coraline debuts in 3D, but overall doesn't take advantage of the technology. Objects don't jump out from the screen, and few scares are derived from poking into the third dimension. If 3D isn't available in your area, don't worry - you're not missing much.- The Massie Twins",3.0,0.2142857142857142,3,4,0.0,neutral,0.9942,very positive,2009,2,5

The character of the Sheriff should provide an anchor for the viewer, afterall, he's the one (from the onset) exposed to the wonders of EUREKA as we follow his entry into the town.Yet within the first few episodes (the pilot is of double length, 83:00min) even the Sherriff seems kinda ho-hum about the whole place.Case in point would be his moving into the underground bunkerhouse. You would think there could be more development in his adjustment period to the place (considering its wonders). Instead it comes off like a sci-fi prop within a few minutes. Ho-hum. Take it all in stride, Sheriff Carter is super cool, etc.The whole concept of this super-functional, technological 'dreamhouse' would get more yuks with a 'The Jetsons' cartoon treatment.

No castles, Death Stars, or Quidditch tournaments, just a gentle story told effectively.A happily married childless couple, Cindy and Jim Green (Jennifer Garner, Joel Edgerton) become frustrated with their inability to conceive, so one night they dream up their ideal offspring and write the child's characteristics and life events on pieces of paper.  They place the notes in a box and bury it in their backyard.  One stormy night, a muddy ten-year-old arrives at their doorstep, claiming the Greens as his own.  Cindy and Jim, along with their small town of Stanleyville, learn that sometimes the unexpected can bring some of life's greatest gifts.""He's a boy with the qualities that his parents hope for,"" says director Peter Hedges, but ""those qualities manifest in ways they never could have imagined.""

It's a fairly typical early 70s Shaw Brothers film that became famous--or infamous--as the first kung-fu flick to be shown in American theaters. There had been many, many films like this before...American audiences just hadn't seen them. Also, some sources list prolific Shaw moviemaker Chang Cheh as the director of ""Five Fingers"". This is incorrect; it was directed by Chang Chang Ho.So, if ""Five Fingers"" is not, after all, the yardstick by which all other martial arts films are measured, what IS it? It's an enjoyable, corny kung-fu programmer, very much a product of its time. The fights are choreographed in fine old Hong Kong style,on a par with Bruce Lee's first two movies; they are not sped up and there are no computer effects(which you weren't expecting in the first place, since this was made in 1971...right?). The climactic battle is a little underwhelming for a Shaw film, but it's adequate. The story is your standard, Chinese-good-guys-versus-Japanese-bad-guys fare, but you have to remember that ""Five Fingers"" was one of the first movies to make use of this storyline--even before Bruce's ""The Chinese Connection"".Above all, you should see it for two reasons: it's one of the few Shaw Brothers films readily available on DVD in the United States(even their average movies were miles ahead of standard Hong Kong fare in terms of martial arts choreography and production values) and it stars Lo Lieh, who passed away three years ago. As the hero, he's holding back just a little here(he was always better in villainous roles), but Lo was one of the true superstars of the genre.

Years pass and bodies start popping up - key in two detectives intent on solving the crime. Detectives M.J. Monahan (Holly Hunter) and Reuben Goetz (Dermot Mulroney) seek out Hudson's aide in finishing off this killer before he makes even bigger headlines.What follows is actually a grossly enriching, deliciously tantalizing thriller that entertained me from the beginning attack to the final exchange. We don't have yet another senseless and mainly plotless thriller spin off here -- although this may explain how this gem got accidently buried.

Some hit the bullseye, and some miss the mark entirely. This one falls somewhere in between. Before I go on any further, let me just say that I have always been a big fan of Michael Keaton and I enjoyed this flick for the fact that he was in a a pretty big and popular film. He seems to disappear for a while and he isn't used as much as he sould be. With that being said, Keaton's return is justified by his humble performance of Jonathan Rivers. Rivers is an architect with a beautiful home on the water, a young son, and a beautiful wife named Anna(who just revealed a happy surprise to Jonathan). But his dream life is taken away from him in an instant when his wife goes missing and is later announced dead. Things in his life change even further when he is visited by a man named Raymond Price, who tells Rivers that he has come into contact with Anna from the ""other side' thru EVP. Known as Electric Voice Phenomena, EVP is a device that many paranormal experts use to communicate with the dead. Voices of the deceased come thru in the snow on your TV or phone, or radio. EVP swallows up Jonathan's existence and he is soon on a neverending quest to hear something from Anna. His new home quickly turning into an audio/video equipment showplace. But as in most thrillers of this nature, not everything is hunky dory. You meddle in death, and you stir up some bad mojo. Messing with the forces of nature. Soon, Jonathan is involved with eerie messages from the beyond on how to find and hopefully save people before they actually die. Plot secrets abound in the form of Anna's true demise, and who are these three strange shadows that appear whenever something bad is going to happen?. All is revealed in an ending that is just as confusing as it is predictable. Jonathan is helped along the way by Sarah(Deborah Kara Unger), a woman who just recently lost her fiancee, and who meets Jonathan while having her own EVP sessions with Price. The movie scores with the fact that it plays on fears, chills, and thrills, while downplaying the usual horror-ish movie standards. While a number of the scares, or ""Jumps"", will chill and even spook some, they still seem to be almost expected. Still, the mood is undeniably creepy and eerie in many places, and director Geoffrey Sax films many of the more chilling and tense moments with the right amount of restraint and straight forwardness that the type of scares it has. The movie's plot and own twists and turns seem to cave in on another as the film goes on, making the film seem to lose it's way before it gets to the big finish, but it delivers for what it is. It's not strikingly new or original, but it holds your interest for the most part and does have some good ""goosebump"" moments. Keaton is always nice to see, and he plays Jonathan as well as he could with the somewhat overwrought material. You pretty much watch every moment he's on screen, and since the cast is very limited, he's on screen pretty much every second. Unger really has nothing to do except to be the friend to lean on and to be there when something happens. Anyone could of done that role in their sleep. With it's flaws, sometimes confusing logic, and plot holes, White Noise can still entertain and deliver some real chills, but it won't stand a ghost of a chance to be included on any good 'ghost movie' list. And even tho Michael Keaton was in ""First Daughter"" with Katie Holmes, this one, and the upcoming ""Herbie"" movie, let's give him more meaty roles that he deserves.

In true Leslie Nielsen fashion, if you watched the ""Naked Gun"" films, you know what to expect for his role.  Marion Ross of ""Happy Days"" fame was quite interesting as the aunt who has a major flatulence problem and just can't stop farting.Tracy Morgan plays a Professor X type of role, trying to help Riker learn his new powers and show him the school of teens who have powers.  Pamela Anderson plays the role of Invisible Woman who has been caught messing around with Professor X by Mrs. Professor X.One of the highlight scenes is when Riker and the girl of his dreams, Jill Johnson are about to share a kiss but his aunt Lucille (Marion Ross) sleeping right next to them leashes continuous farts that just sound so horrible.  Fart jokes can be funny and the manage to include a hilarious gassy scenes in which Jill who really wants to kiss Riker, uses her tampons to put up her nose to avoid smelling the fart. Fart jokes are gross but when done well, you can't hep but laugh.Of course, probably the coldest jokes are the ones on physicist Stephen Hawking.  The gags on his character featured getting his head accidentally stuck in a beehive and not able to get out of it because of his disability.  And of course, using his vocoder device to simulate Hawking screaming profanities. For a film to really make fun of his disability to get some cheap laughs is just very cold.There are so many gags in this film with those type of gags, some quite funny and some that are just idiotic but I found this film more to the funny side fortunately.  But with jokes such as the Stephen Hawking (which there are numerous scenes with this character), I can see many finding it tasteless and some to find it so funny knowing it's so wrong.AUDIO & VIDEO:Truthfully, I wasn't paying too much attention towards the quality of the film and as for the audio, the film is strictly dialogue.  Not much need for special audio effects.SPECIAL FEATURES:The extended version features the alternate ending, deleted scenes, two featurettes and a theatrical trailer plus a commentary.  The regular version only features the alternate ending (which was so dumb, I'm glad they didn't use it), deleted scenes and the theatrical trailer.There are three versions of this film on DVD in the US.  The regular version which is only 74 minutes long and has only the alternate ending, deleted scenes and theatrical trailer, while the extended version which is 82 minutes long and has the additional commentary track and featurettes.  The third version is a Blockbuster exclusive which features additional deleted scenes.So, far of the movies within this genre and created by the same creators of ""SCARY MOVIE"" and ""NAKED GUN"", of the more recent films, ""SUPERHERO MOVIE"" was probably the funniest compared to the others. Again, this is comparing to the other related films by the same creators.There is a lot of funny jokes throughout the film but there are also a good number of idiotic jokes as well.I enjoyed the superhero film parodies on this film and although there are a few well-known talent who made cameos on this film, I'm just glad many of their segments were quite short.  In fact, I'm glad that the film was quite short.In the end, I definitely didn't find myself disliking it.  I suppose it's because I enjoyed the superhero parodies on the film and I haven't seen a film go so far to do a parody based on superhero films in this magnitude.All in all, a fun film if you come watching with an open mind.",3.0,1.0,8,1,-0.6329,very negative,0.9987,very positive,2008,11,3

375001,6303449050,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,5,6,2010-02-20,A Model of Realism,"'Umberto D.' is the detailed, meticulously presented, monochrome portrayal of an aging pensioner in Rome, who, along with his dog Flike, struggles to survive in the dispassionate atmosphere of post-war Italy.  Under the threat of eviction from his landlady over past due rent, unable to feed both himself and his dog, and with no one else to rely on, Umberto considers taking his own life.  However, in the process, he nearly loses the one thing that has any meaning to him in this harsh world, and the film's ending, while unclear and indeterminate, hints that he finds a different perspective as he renews his contest with life.Film historians generally credit the director Vittorio De Sica ('The Bicycle Thief', 'The Garden of the Fitz-Continis') as a leading figure in the Italian Neorealist trend of films after WWII, and consider 'Umberto D.' to be one the classics of the movement, as well as its finale.  Non-professional actors on location, performance of mundane tasks in a conventional manner, and reflecting the conditions of the poor all marked the traits of Neorealism, and 'Umberto D.' conforms in every way to these standards.  This was, in fact, the aspect of the film that I enjoyed most - the unvarnished look at Roman and Italian life shortly after the war.  Its concentration on the 'real' comes through splendidly, and I was impressed while watching the film that here was a depiction of a time and place that was unique to the moment, preserved for as long as the film exists.Ultimately, though, this is an austere film, as it was no doubt intended to be, and some viewers may find, as I did, that its bleak presentation drags.  Though each realist segment is without any overt flaws, linked together I thought they tended toward extraneous and tedious.  One's enjoyment of the film, therefore, will depend a lot on whether you appreciate the techniques of Neorealism in movies or not - and for those who aren't familiar with them, I think I can safely recommend 'Umberto D.' as an excellent example.  Viewers weaned on linear films that only concentrate the camera lens on the portion of real life that advances the plot may find themselves somewhat puzzled by films like 'Umberto D., though I think they can sometimes be an interesting switch.One note about the film's emotional impact - whether or not one has a fervent reaction will also have a lot to do with how well the techniques of this movement resonate.  It's even described as a tearjerker by some, but its ambiguous ending does not necessarily imply anything.  Those who are affected most may be reacting to the presentation of human dignity in a cold-blooded world, which I think the film accomplishes well, albeit slowly.  I found the ending affirming, actually, without negating the reality De Sica worked hard to portray.In the end, even though I would not consider this one of the greatest films ever, I would recommend it to those who appreciate realism in film, and who have the patience to stick with a film that is loyal only to its own pacing.",3.0,0.8333333333333334,2,1,0.0,neutral,0.9812,very positive,2010,2,20

I don't own the movie but I've watched it several times.  The robot lover was entertaining as well.  The special effects and graphics were top notch.  Spielberg always does a good job in that area.  But the problem I am having is that I'm trying pretty hard to figure out what the movie is about.  David is trying to become real so he sets out on a 'pilgrimage' to find the 'blue fairy'.  The reason he believes in this is because his mommy read Pinocchio to him.  I know that much.  I also understand that he is saying that the end of the world is near because we are trying to get rid of the macines because humans won't live forever and all that will be left is machines because humans will destroy themselves.  Im guessing thats what it is but if someone can give me more insight into this then that will be greatly appreciated.

The conclusion is so full of twists and turns, nooks and crannies, false leads and red herrings that it become mind-boggling to follow. This one is a humorless episode in which we see very little of the by-play between Inspector Morse (John Thaw) and Sergeant Lewis (Kevin Whately). We don't see Morse's stinginess sticking Lewis with pub bills or his tendency to tipple. It's a single-minded Morse that is less fun than the usual.A husband and wife, The Brewsters, both doctors operate a private clinic. One particular operation went tragically wrong with Dr. Brewster as the surgeon and his wife Claire as anesthesiologist and assisted by Nurse Hazlitt. The patient, a young girl Avril, never regained consciousness, and she is in a coma from which she will never recover. The father Michael Steppings (Brian Cox), a wealthy bookmaker, sues the doctors and nurse, and loses the case. He threatens the trio in court.Two years later Dr. Brewster's body is found in his garage, apparently a suicide. Very quickly it is determined to be a murder. Viewers are going to be very suspicious of the Brewster's son John who acts very guiltily as he slinks around.Steppings visits his daughter, kept alive on life-supports, every day and reads to her. Morse begins bonding with the father and sharing his anguish. Steppings is a prime suspect, and he is investigated. Before his death Dr. Brewster received some threatening letters, but none went to his wife or the nurse apparently.At the end we find out about a complicated series of events that took place. We are led in one direction only to find that a new area of investigation has opened.

It's not completely unheard of and I've encountered friends who weren't able to come to terms with their sexuality until much later in life. But it would have helped if Paul had had other on the fly &#34;experiments&#34; over the years, even if only under the influence of alcohol. To have completely no idea about this side in him primarily because of conversations with a young guy in the park was a bit of a stretch, but I suppose one just have to buy into the movie logic at work here.And for the young man to claim to be wary about things in the beginning but still feel like he was somehow cheated or used in the process of becoming more intimate with Paul just felt very immature. I could see this turn coming from a mile a way but I still hoped against hope that it wouldn't go down this road. But of course a movie needs conflict and the first night together was of course going to be used as the vehicle for movie drama moments. I think the movie makers could have gone in a new direction in this area, but clearly it was an opportunity wasted.And it's a shame since there were some genuinely interesting moments during the various conversations between Paul and Andy. But all that had to give way to the predictably &#34;clever&#34; interconnections factored into the story once you bring in the plot threads related to Elise's son. They made sure there were plenty of reasons for the various characters to mix up the plot later in the movie. Paul was Brian's confidant while Elise already suspected he was gay. She tries to attend a PFLAG to better understand her son and this leads her to meeting Andy, who is a volunteer. Rince, lather and repeat.The movie isn't the rib-tickling variety of comedy.

1207372,B001K3GO60,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,5,5,2011-10-09,A fusion-type kettlebell workout,"I picked up this DVD used without knowing anything about it:  on the outside of my copy (which is just a cardboard sleeve), it says ""Bonus Kettlebell DVD & Workout Guide,"" and it also carries the Danskin Now label.  On the inside, however, it contains instructor Gin Miller's information, and the DVD itself is titled Calorie Burner Workout with Kettlebells, the same as what is being sold here under different packaging.  After doing some research, I learned that in addition to being sold separately, this DVD is included with the purchase of all Danskin Now (Empower) kettlebells, which come in 5, 8, and 10 lb. increments.Gin works out alone in a bright studio with wood floors.  The screen sometimes splits into double or triple views to show different angles.  The Main Menu for this DVD appears as follows:Safety GuidelinesWarm-UpWorkout 1Workout 2Workout 3Cool Down/StretchIf you select the Safety Guidelines, Gin appears within a small inset screen on the main menu.  I was disappointed in this brief (&lt;3 minutes) overview, mainly because Gin suggests starting with very light kettlebells.  She seems to be suggesting weights consistent with the Empower brand (i.e., 5, 8, and 10 lbs.) rather than recommending the heavier weight ranges that most certified kettlebell instructors usually suggest, even for beginners.  NOTE:  Gin is NOT a certified kettlebell instructor.)I was further disappointed in the Warm-Up.  Here Gin walks viewers through what she calls kettlebell ""throws"" (I have no idea why she uses her own terminology rather than to simply say kettlebell swings).  Gin's form for the throw/swing is totally incorrect, as she bases the move on a squat rather than on a deadlift; attempt this move with a lighter kettlebell only further exacerbates the problem.  I am very concerned that those with no prior kettlebell experience might follow Gin's poor form and learn bad habits which could potentially lead to injury.Each of the three workout segments is meant to stand alone; in fact, you are automatically returned to the Main Menu after each ends (there is no ""Play All"" option).  I have broken down each segment in greater detail below.Workout #1, 9 minutesGin begins this segment with her version of the kettlebell swing, kettlebell ""throws.""  Not only does she perform the swing move incorrectly, but also she doesn't even hold the kettlebell by the top of the handle--she holds it by the handle sides.  I simply substituted correct swing form while she was doing her version.  Other exercises included chest press (holding the kettlebell in both hands), overhead shoulder press, and upright rows with side toe tap.  The final move is a squat side to side to which Gin adds a swinging high overhead pull; this seemed somewhat unsafe to me, so I just did squats with cleans instead.  Similarly, she performs swinging bicep curls that I skipped.Workout #2, 14 minutesThis section was my favorite of the three.  Gin starts here with lunge and row, adding a row with throw; I stuck with just the row.  Next comes a series that begins with passing the kettlebell under one knee; this is followed by a one-leg deadlift-type move, touching the kettlebell to the floor.  Gin then combines these two moves together, passing the kettlebell under the knee, doing the deadlift, and passing the the kettlebell back again.  Gin finishes with some triceps overhead presses.Workout #3, 14.5 minutesFor this segment, Gin begins with a back lunge, first not using the kettlebell at all.  She then adds the kettlebell to hold, progressing to an overhead chop (I stuck with the hold).  In-between sides, she stretches the back/hamstrings with a hip hinge.  She also performs a Figure 8 move that involves weaving the kettlebell to either side (but not under the legs as with other kettlebell workouts).  The final move is what she calls an ""angel squat"":  basically a plie moving into lifting the kettlebell overhead.Cool Down/Stretch (5 minutes)Gin leads the view through some basic standing stretches here, beginning with stretching the sides/torso, moving on to the hamstrings (using the kettlebell to assist with balance), including the arms/shoulders, and ending with a few deep breaths.I describe this as a ""fusion"" kettlebell workout both because it is appropriate to be performed with a slightly lighter kettlebell (I'm talking 10 lbs., not 5 lbs.) and because many of the exercises are not unique to kettlebell work.  Unfortunately, however, Gin simply does not do a particularly good job with this DVD.  She gets the fundamental kettlebell exercise, the swing (her ""throw""), TOTALLY wrong.  Those who have experience with kettlebells like myself will be able to make their own adjustments, but beginners could risk trouble if they attempt to follow along with Gin.If you are new to kettlebells and are looking for a fusion-type workout, I would recommendPower Body: Kettlebell Bootcamp with Angie Milleror perhaps one of the Paul Katami DVDs (which I haven't tried).  I will keep this DVD (for now), as I think I can modify the one workout I liked to meet my own needs.  Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it, and my final rating would be 2 1/2 stars.",3.0,1.0,3,1,0.0,neutral,-0.9612,very negative,2011,10,9
561624,B00004Z4WR,A5DIAZ5GT3MC,5,6,2005-07-09,"""More"" Gone In Sixty Seconds!","In the VHS era, the ""extended cut"" was generally reserved for Jim Cameron films like ""Aliens"" and ""T2: Judgment Day"". They gave movie fans a chance to see elaborate sequences that were often cut due to the overly-long running times of the features. With the introduction of DVD, major studios are cashing in by putting together extended cuts of major blockbusters by throwing in some missing scenes. In some cases, the ""unrated"" cut is the version that the director intended to be seen but due to the MPAA giving it an ""NC-17"" rating, the studio is forced to hold off until home video in order to show it in its uncut form. Lately though, ""Unrated"" is just a new word thrown out to make the new version seem like it's too extreme to be shown in theatres, when it's actually just the same version with scenes included that weren't given a rating by the MPAA.There is no guiltier pleasure than the Jerry Bruckheimer summer blockbuster. It's where music video directors go to cut their teeth in the movie industry and Oscar winners go to get their payday. 2000's remake of ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" with Bruckheimer staples Nicolas Cage and Will Patton is the ultimate celebration of all things one should associate with Bruckheimer. It's a big, loud car chase film filled with outrageous stunts, phoned-in performances, cliche characters, bad racial stereotypes, and a whole lot of noise.""60 Seconds"" stars Nicolas Cage as retired car theif, Memphis Raines, who is forced back into the game when a cheesy mobster type (with perhaps the most annoying accent in cinema history) threatens to kill his younger brother if he doesn't steal 50 cars in one night. Along for the ride is Delroy Lindo's veteran police officer who is still stewing over the missed opportunity of arresting Raines in his ""heyday"". There's plenty of great actors standing around including Robert Duvall, Angelina Jolie, and the afore-mentioned Patton. There's also hardly a racial sterotype that the movie doesn't throw in. You've got the Asian girl who can't drive, the Mexican car-jackers protecting their turf, and T.J. Cross as the ""token black guy"" who knows he's the token black guy and won't shut up about it. Still despite it all, I'd be lying if I said this movie isn't watchable.This extended version is released as the ""director's cut"" so one can assume director Dominic Sena put his stamp of approval on this one. You might think that with a luxury like this, he would have included a few more character moments but in fact, the strongest such moment in the theatrical cut, a sequence with Nicolas Cage and Giovani Risbi has actually been removed and replaced with an alternate scene that is far less powerful. For its ""nine minutes of added footage"", there are a few subtle differences but nothing worth writing home about. As for its ""Unrated"" tag, if this cut were submitted to the MPAA, it would more than likely receive the same PG-13 rating as the theatrical version.

Elle Fanning delivers a deceptively difficult performance as the openhearted country girl with a crush with casual-looking naturalism. Maggie Elizabeth Jones does a great job as the precocious youngest child while Matt Damon and Colin Ford are credibly prickly toward each other as father and son.The film occasionally botches credibility with ridiculous events that even I, who have never worked with animals, responded to with big distracting ""No efin way.""-- Like the huge shipping crate packed tight with random snakes from around the world; No efin way snakes would have been shipped that way - even if they happened to originate from the same part of the world - most, if not all, of them would have suffocated and larger ones that survived would eat the smaller ones.-- And then right after they escape (of course, if there's a huge crate full of snakes they're going to escape) the snakes all conveniently gather in the front yard.

Hoping to flee Chicago with his stripper girlfriend Angel Face, he keeps putting it off with bouts of cold feet. Then one night when Johnny is assigned a new partner, Angel finally grows tired of false hopes and promises, just as Johnny is tempted by the dark side to finally realise both their dreams, but other factors are heading their way.....Directed by John H. Auer and starring Gig Young as Kelly, City That Never Sleeps was brought to us out of the low budget Republic Pictures studio. Oddly fusing film-noir with fantastical elements makes for a most intriguing watch, yet it's very much a slog to get to a point where you feel your time has been worth it. But crucially it is worth the wait, lots of character strands all thread together to give us an exciting, and well executed climax, tho the fantastical finish point is something of a head scratcher to me personally. It's a weird film in many ways, and one that probably needs repeat viewings to fully grasp {and appreciate} what the hell is going on with all these characters. The weird feel is emphasised by John L. Russell's {Psycho & The Cabinet of Caligari} grimly lighted photography, who utilises the sparseness of the actual Chicago locations to great effect.Known to be a favourite film of Martin Scorsese, City That Never Sleeps is actually a little better than it's B movie tagging. But it remains a film that one feels should have been much better. It's alright to fuse more than a couple of genre's, but you have to make it work convincingly within the structure of the plot{s}, and realistically they only just manage to pull it off, courtesy of a fine, if weird, ending. 6/10 but it could go either way upon a further viewing.",3.0,0.8,1,1,0.0,neutral,0.9831,very positive,2011,9,29

The violence in this film is extreme, pretty much to the point of overshadowing everything else. This wouldn't have been a problem has this been a highly stylized parody, something that's willing to flaunt its intentional gratuitousness. Consider last month's ""300,"" an over the top male fantasy in which limbs fly, heads roll, and blood sprays from gaping wounds. Yes, the violence was incredibly overplayed, but it was supposed to be. It's a comic book fable drenched in testosterone, and that enabled the audience to take it with a grain of salt. ""Pathfinder"" doesn't have the guts to point at itself and laugh; every scene is somber and dripping with emotion, qualities that don't allow such acts of violence to be tolerated.It doesn't help that the story is paper thin, practically bordering on nonexistent. What little story we have is overshadowed by wall-to-wall action sequences. Did director Marcus Nispel (who also directed 2003's incredible remake of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"") really think that forgoing plot and character development would benefit this film? I'll be the first to admit that action scenes are fun to watch. Still, a solid story has to back them up; otherwise, all you'll have is a series of swordfights, stabbings, and beheadings that don't add up to anything worthwhile. I wanted to laugh and clap my hands while watching this film. I wanted to feel invigorated. I was let down; by the time I left the theater, I was emotionally drained.Here's the plot. Long, long ago, a ruthless army of Vikings invaded North America, slaughtering every Native American tribe they happen to come across. After one such massacre, the young son of a prominent Viking warrior was left behind (he defied his father by refusing to murder a ""savage""). Discovered by a passing woman, the frightened child is taken in and raised amidst a local tribe. The story then flashes forward fifteen years, at which point the abandoned Viking is now an adult (Karl Urban). Because of his distinctly Scandinavian complexion, he's called Ghost, a name that's difficult to accept as either insulting or affectionately playful (I'm surprised he took to it at all, but never mind). Despite being raised as part of this tribe, nightmares of the day he was abandoned leave him confused over his true identity. Which of his two worlds does he belong in? Only one? Both? Neither?The answer to that question comes when a new army of Vikings begins an invasion. Many of Ghost's fellow tribesmen are brutally murdered, including his kindhearted mother. This ignites the fires of revenge, which, as you probably guessed, entails hunting down and destroying every Viking he comes into contact with. Needless to say, such a decision paves the way for even more gory death scenes, all of which go just this side of too far. It also paves the way for sequence in which Ghost causes an avalanche, which would have been acceptable had the footage not looked like something from a National Geographic special.There's really no need to delve further into the plot; that pretty much sums it up. There's no rule stating that a story has to be complicated in order to be good. In this regard, ""Pathfinder"" delivers; this is your basic revenge story, and it plays out exactly the way one would expect it to. Some may even appreciate the fact that the dialogue is sparse, with each character getting fewer than ten lines into the entire film (which is a brisk eighty-eight minutes, I might add). Action film buffs will get a kick out of this movie because there's nothing to emotionally invest in, especially in terms of the characters. It's a bare-bones series of death scenes, all of which are milked for all that they're worth.But this time--unfortunately--the violence doesn't add to the appeal of the film. Had this been a super stylized fable, a story that reveled in its bloodiness, then it could have been a rip-roaring good time. It fails in that it tries to be something more, namely a human drama of self-discovery. We know that Ghost is fighting against his own kind, but we don't really get to see how this is affecting him. He may have been raised in a different culture, but his Viking roots are inescapable. If the filmmakers truly wanted to play up the drama, they could have explored his conflicting emotions. True, that would detract from the death scenes, but at least it would give this film some depth. The best we're given is a romantic subplot with a woman from another tribe (Moon Bloodgood). Not only does their relationship add nothing to the film, it also goes nowhere.I know I should be seeing ""Pathfinder"" in a different light; believe it or not, part of me does want to recommend it for the sheer escapism of it. But I don't feel this is something one should escape to. The violence is too strong for the emotion to sink in. Likewise, the drama is too prominent for the violence to be entertaining. If you truly want to get your money's worth from needless violence, ""300"" is your best bet.",3.0,0.6666666666666666,7,1,-0.5719,negative,-0.9732,very negative,2007,4,14

1124267,B00104QSOM,AGHJ9BMVMGIOL,8,15,2008-04-11,Not the Masterpiece It Wants to Be,"""There Will Be Blood,"" which, if you haven't heard about, or seen, tells the story of an early-20th century oil tycoon, named Daniel Plainview, making his fortune in the American west. The movie tracks Plainview's rise from a lone miner (in the beginning, we see him break his leg going deep underground to grab $3 worth of gold) to a ruthless and powerful millionaire. Plainview eventually conquers a large patch of California oil territory. At the end of the movie, he is a wealthy but bitter, deranged man, shouting at his adopted son like a mad sultan.On a positive note, the movie looks fantastic. The period details--from the dress to the oil rigging to the polished bar wood--are excellent, and the movie won a deserved Oscar for cinematography. Daniel Day-Lewis is good in the role of Daniel Plainview, but familiar. He seems to be playing Bill the Butcher again, only this time on the West rather than East coast. Day-Lewis plays the role as bigger than life, but after a while, the movie needs less grandeur and more subtle humanity.I found the movie challenging, but also disappointing. For one, it's way too long. It might have been a great movie had it been about 100 minutes or so. But it simply doesn't have enough plot to justify its length. And in its two and a half hours, Day-Lewis's character occupies almost all of every scene. We don't like Plainview that much at the beginning. By the end, we loathe him. Most of the supporting cast members simply look on as we watch Day-Lewis dominate the proceedings.All this would be okay, I think, if director Paul Thomas Anderson knew when to let us have enough. Unfortunately, the movie's misanthropy is unrelenting and ultimately self-indulgent. That doesn't make for fun viewing. Some critics, such as Peter Travers and Roger Ebert, have brought up parallels between this movie and Citizen Kane. Kane, however, had a main character we cared about and secondary characters that were well-defined and sympathetic. Here, we see Plainview stomp and shout and threaten and drool, and after a while, we wish someone would put a bullet through his head. Charles Foster Kane could be cruel, but he was more sad than tyrannical. Plainview merely is a greedy sociopath.Citizen Kane also had a goal: we wanted to find out what ""Rosebud"" meant. Would Kane's last words solve the mystery of his life? Here, there's no sense of climax. It ends long after we feel it should have ended. And Anderson's handling of the last scene goes horribly wrong. It becomes a farce. Ever see an ending to a movie and feel like your watching the DVD extras--the version that was cut out--but you're not?Anderson is at his best when he doesn't try so hard. His first film, ""Hard Eight,"" and his previous one, ""Punch Drunk Love,"" are more focused than his more ambitious projects ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia."" Anderson has lots of talent, but like his contemporary Quentin Tarantino, he's erratic. Film buffs should demand of Anderson a movie that's more than just dust, blood, whiskey, and Old Testament bluster. ""There Will Be Blood"" starts promisingly, but as its main character descends into madness, the drama gets weaker not stronger. ""There Will Be Blood"" is, at its core, about con men, but in the end, we feel like the ones who have been cheated.",3.0,0.5333333333333333,2,4,-0.5096,negative,0.9594,very positive,2008,4,11

Australia put ABBA on the map when in that year (1975), our TV rock show ""Countdown"" gave considerable exposure to the video clips ""SOS"" and ""MamaMia"", before any other country had noticed them.  The latter went on to be a huge No. 1 hit and ABBAmania took over Australia.  This is a significant point, because in 1977 they toured Australia and Swedish film-makers followed to capture the concert and turn it into a movie titled ""ABBA: The Movie"".  The film featured stunning concert performances of early ABBA material and their then new album ""Arrival"".  In between this concert footage was a storyline about an Australian journalist desperate to secure an interview with the four super Swedes, which sees him following them all around Australia until he gets his wish.  This movie, in my opinion, is the best way to capture the concert atomosphere of ABBA.  The problem is, this movie is still unavailable on DVD.  I am not even sure if it was released to the American public, but it was a No. 1 box office smash in Australia and Europe in 1978.Now, on to this new DVD release : ABBA in Concert.  I read many negative reviews of this DVD, but as a true ABBA fan, wanted to make up my own mind, so purchased the DVD.  This DVD is basically a documentary from 1979 featuring ABBA's tour of America and UK.  Much of it has been seen before on American TV (apparently).  The American concert footage is brief and consists more of backstage stuff and sightseeing trips.  The UK footage is better because you get more concert footage even, although some songs are noticeably edited (eg. Chiquitita).  This is because the documentary was originally made for TV and had time limitations. The total amount of songs listed is 12.  To me, the best part of this DVD is the inclusion of ""The Way Old Friends Do"", previously unseen in Europe, Australia and America.  This is part of the bonus material on the DVD, and is worth the high price tag of the DVD alone.  Other bonus features include interviews with the documentary producer ... but this did not appeal to me.  There is also edited footage of ""Thank YOu for the Music"" which is interesting because much of the concert footage for this track remains missing, so the DVD producers have done some splicing etc to give a complete finish to the song.  It has been well done in my opinion, and you cannot tell that footage is missing.Overall, the DVD overall is disappointing in my opinion.  It left me wanting more, and it is too expensive for what you get.  I urge American fans to purchase the VHS of ""ABBA: The Movie"" (until it's released on DVD). It's the best way to see incredible concert footage of this band.  Plus you will experience the impact that ABBA had on Australia back in 1977 when it was filmed.

My reply was of course, ""you mean if Edgar had never lived & they came up with the creatures, topography, alien races & the leads had no characteristics to go with them so they could write any story they wanted & assign characteristics to the roles as they see fit?

Fans of Burroughs will be turned off by this travesty of an interpretation of A Princess of Mars. I can't recommend it to Burroughs fans, myself included.Still the acting is great, the creatures looked exactly as described in the book & the topography was too. Why they assassinated the leads characters was totally baffling except for writer or director ego. They thought they could do better & they are always wrong.

Stone Cold Steve Austin had just won his first WWF Championship at WrestleMania but by the following night was told to do things ""the easy way or the hard way"" with WWF Owner Vince McMahon. After Austin made his choice, it began a series of events that lead to a full-fledged feud between Austin & McMahon. On one particular night during the first official Austin/McMahon meeting, Mick Foley returned to his Dude Love character & proceeded to attack Austin much to the surprise of everyone else to get this title shot while McMahon also made it clear that he was going to be at ringside for this particular match (playing up the previous Survivor Series). Also, The Undertaker & Kane took their feud to the next level resorting to a first for the WWF, The Inferno match. One more thing, the night after WrestleMania Faarooq was kicked out of his organization as his fellow members turned on him with The Rock declaring himself as leader & ruler of the Nation while DX received a new change with Shawn Michaels being out of action, Triple H taking over as leader & bringing in new DX members in the New Age Outlaws & the returning X-Pac (WCW's Syxx/1-2-3 Kid).Faarooq, Ken Shamrock & Steve Blackman vs The Nation. This particular group of the Nation was The Rock, D'lo Brown & Kama with Mark Henry at ringside. Each man had a score to settle with the Nation but none bigger than Faarooq whose intentions was to get even with The Rock. The Nation worked as a team by isolating Blackman for most of the match while Shamrock & Faarooq were working together but were trying to get even for their own agendas before one man got what he wanted in the end.WWF European Champion Triple H vs Owen Hart. The rematch from WrestleMania but this time, the added stipulation was that Chyna was going to be suspended above the ring a steel cage. Without having to worry about Chyna, Owen was able to take the fight right to Triple H and even taunt Chyna on a few occassions. Triple H was able to regain control & even attempted to ground Owen on several occassions. However, this match took a unique turn of events as Chyna was able to do something that nobody thought was possible before it was another member of DX that ended up getting involved that finally caused Owen Hart to snap.""New"" Midnight Express vs The Rock & Roll Express. Jim Cornette had brought back Bob Holly & Bart Gunn & renamed them the new Midnight Express while also turning on the Rock & Roll Express. The Express were past their prime at this point so this match wasn't really much past watchable with the only highlight being Cornette's interaction with the referee but overall, this was not even close to the quality of matches that the Express had with the ""real"" Midnight Express.Evening Gown Match: Sable vs Luna. This was a first as this was a match in which the only way to win is to strip your opponent's evening gown off. Nothing much here past the usual T&A; from this era.WWF Tag Team Champions The New Age Outlaws vs L.O.D 2000. This was the climax to the months long feud between these two teams as the Outlaws had beaten, humliated & even at one point seemed to break up the LOD till WrestleMania where the LOD returned with a new look & manager in Sunny. Before the match, The Outlaws ran down North Carolina along with subtle lines towards the LOD. However, this match was similar to their previous matches in which they had a slow paced tag match but I will give credit in that Animal & Hawk put more effort into this match than they did in their previous match. The match itself was average but pay close attention to the finish as it didn't set well with the LOD that even had the referee suffer for his call.Inferno Match: The Undertaker vs Kane. The first ever Inferno match & for those keeping track, this is the second meeting between these two but also the first of two Inferno matches between these two. Considering the limitations that this match had with the ring being surrounded by fire, these two went above & beyond the call of duty. They exchanged high impact moves such as chokeslams & even a suplex from the top rope with both men using a chair at one point along with one man returning who had his issues with Kane as well before Taker was able to get the revenge he had been seeking for months on not just Kane but also Paul Bearer. This was quite the spectacle to see with flames adding visuals but speaking of visuals, check out Taker's dive out of the ring over the flames to solidify that statement.WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Dude Love. Austin's first title defense comes against a man that was once Austin's Tag Team Champion/Partner in Dude Love who jumped Austin right from the start & listen closely early to Jim Ross's shoot towards WCW in regards to Austin's career. Austin was able to turn the tide & take the brawl up the entrance way before both men battling on top of the concert stage with Dude taking a fall off the stage that you just knew had to hurt. Dude was able to regain control off one mistake from Austin before working over Austin's previous injured neck. The big story here was the appearance of Vince McMahon which raised speculation of a Montreal Revisit with even moments of Vince & the timekeeper (who Austin threatened earlier in the night) making eye contact at times while also getting into confrontations with Austin. This one got out of control once the referee went down, both men brawling around the ringside area, the front row, Austin suplexing Dude onto the steel steps before a chair got involved & McMahon ended up paying the price for getting involved one time too many. This was a prelude to their more famous match a month later at Over the Edge but this was still a very good main event that left you wanting more when it was done.Overall, the only matches here that weren't much was the Express match & Evening Gown match (unless you just want to see women in bikinis) while the main events were good quality as well as others pushing the storylines which I think was at it's peak during this particular time of the Attitude Era. However with the main events already being released on DVD, I'd recommend seeing this if you can see it online or even a cheap price.",3.0,0.0,3,1,0.3612,positive,-0.454,negative,2013,8,30

The way the gang members silently walked about outside and just mindlessly rushed the building later despite getting shot so easily, they seemed more like zombies. Granted, zombies with silencer equipted weaponry, but members of the mindless undead just the same.As for the confrontation between the father and the gang members who killed his daughter, I found that very unconvincing. I think it would have been much more believable had he not found the gun in the ice cream truck but instead just rammed the gang members' car off the road with his own and than beat them to death with a tire iron (would have been more emotionally satisfying as well). It would also explain why he did not get into his car and drive away (which is something I did not understand).",3.0,1.0,1,2,-0.5927,negative,-0.8503,very negative,2008,6,10
1195569,B001GCUO16,A2HVL790PBWYTU,1,2,2009-11-27,Longing for a more thrilling snikt,"The Canuck who goes ""snikt"" is back and in his own feature film, and my tepid reaction goes along the lines of ""Um.. oh.. huh."" X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE is serviceable enough, but in no way does it elevate the X-Men film franchise to new heights. There's always peril in disclosing a character's mysterious past, that the doing of it may possibly sabotage the character's existing appeal. Sometimes, things are better left alone, better left to the viewer's imaginations lest the reality not live up to all the fun speculations. In having long-withheld details from his murky past finally revealed, Wolverine ends up being less interesting. And the big, exciting reveals end up not so big, not so exciting. For a vehicle featuring a mutant berserker who's the best at what he does - which is fighting - X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE lacks punch.Hugh Jackman isn't bad as Logan. Okay, I had to get over the fact that Logan in the comic books stands at only 5'3,"" and not 6'2,"" which is Jackman's height. Because, for me, part of Wolverine's appeal is that he's often the smallest runt in the place and still he tears  up the shizzy. Another thing is that Jackman doesn't quite convincingly demonstrate that utterly berserko rage that Logan succumbs to. So, not feral enough, vicious enough, scruffy enough, or, yeah, smelly enough. Hugh Jackman isn't bad as Logan. But he's too, I dunno, elegant? Tame?The film begins somewhen in 1845, which is when young James Howlett's (Wolverine/Logan's real name) mutant abilities first truly kick in. We note James' popping of his retractable bone claws, the tragedy in his home, the panicked dash thru the woods, the show of togetherness by Victor Creed, James' older half-brother, and then we're off to the opening credits to catch brief glimpses of James and Victor adventuring thru various wars down the decades. Thru the years Victor (a very good Liev Shreiber) becomes increasingly bestial and amoral and you could see James growing more and more concerned about this. It was never gonna end well between the two. If you read the X-Men titles, you know this, that Wolverine and Sabertooth are the bitterest of enemies.In telling Logan's story, the movie skips key junctures in his past, or since this is the movie version, maybe Logan simply never did venture to Madripoor or get married in Japan. During 'Nam, we do see him and Victor being handpicked by Colonel Stryker for Team X, a black ops unit peopled with hardened mutants. We witness Stryker's interest in the rare metal alloy known as adamantium, and we fans know how adamantium impacts Wolverine later on. The movie cherry picks (and sometimes throws a curve on) elements from the Wolverine mythos. We follow Logan as he encounters Silverfox and later undergoes the excruciatingly painful Weapon X experiment. The film peppers in various superhero scuffles as Wolverine and Sabertooth separately throw down with various mutants, all this culminating in a showdown on Three Mile Island. But the disappointing thing is that most of the action sequences don't get you up as they should.I get the sense that Gambit and especially Deadpool were spotlighted with eventually having them star in their own movies in mind. Except that Taylor Kitsch underwhelms as Remy LeBeau. On the other hand, Ryan Reynolds as the mouthy merc Wade Wilson is very promising. Ryan Reynolds is at his scene-stealing best and, in one scene, as Wade Wilson furiously deflects bullets with his flashing swords, he solidifies himself as the baddest dude in a roomful of bad dudes. So I'm sold on the Deadpool movie. Actually, that whole sequence in which Team X invades a well-defended structure in Lagos, Nigeria counts as the most scintillating action sequence in the film. However, what they later do to Deadpool is just too much. I also wasn't down with the out-of-left-field reimagining of Blob. A fun thing, though, is that I once again get to play the ""Identify that Cameo"" game. Most prominent are a young Cyclops and Emma Frost. But see if you could pick out the others.The movie gives us a momentary glimpse of Logan being happy, the operative word being ""momentary."" We see Logan suffering a tragic loss and giving in to his inner rage and losing his inhibitions. And yet, as portrayed by Hugh Jackman, when Wolverine loses it, in my eyes, he doesn't lose it enough. The PG-13 rating may also be to blame for this. Word is that a sequel is already underway. I'm crossing my fingers for an Alpha Flight sighting.Lastly, Wade Wilson just cracks me up. Mouthy as he is, he doesn't really get a chance to mouth off. However, he does manage to get on Sabertooth's bad side when he observes that Sabertooth has the ""fingernails of a bag lady.""",3.0,0.5,10,1,0.5095,positive,0.9465,very positive,2009,11,27

It's a clever idea: if there really were vampires and they could spread like a virus, why wouldn't they soon run the world rather than slink around in shadows?  It turns out this film shows exactly why, if they're smart, vampires would stay out of sight and wouldn't want to spread.  Vampires do rule the world in this film, and human beings are the ones who have to creep about during the day, hidden as best they can from their refined and powerful predators.  The problem is that the vampires are running out of humans to harvest, and without human blood they gradually devolve into something darker and more demonic, Nosferatu-style bat-like beasts with no trace of remaining humanity.The basic plot is simple enough, and should be familiar to those who rememberDances with WolvesorPocahontas, or the much more recentAvatar: Ethan Hawke plays the outsider from a conquering race who comes to sympathize with and eventually fight alongside the conquered race, in part because his first encounter is with a beautiful woman he falls for.The execution is not perfect.  The dialogue is full of cliches, and the final solution is all too convenient. It's a bit somber, and almost entirely lacking in the kind of dark humor or wit of a film likeNear Dark. There's nothing all that memorable about the cinematography or editing, and I found myself thinking it might be more fitting in a television series.  In fact there were several elements of the story that were overly compressed or unexplained, and that might have been fleshed out in a miniseries, and might have been more interesting in that medium.  As it is, this is a moderately entertaining vampire flick that's different enough to be worth watching for fans of the genre and engaging and accessible enough to be a decent way for the rest of us (at least those who aren't overly squeamish) to kill a couple hours. Nothing profound or unique here, but decent bloody entertainment.",3.0,0.9523809523809524,4,1,0.7615,very positive,0.764,very positive,2010,5,15
1117517,B000YABYLA,A120V3RVSK1O1K,0,6,2011-05-06,Juno; A Catholic's Review,"This movie was an unusual case.  It's a movie about how a young, immature, teenage girl discovers she's pregnant after spontaneous sex with a young, slightly-more-mature, teenage boy, and how she copes with it.  She contemplates abortion at first, but ultimately, chooses adoption instead.  It amazes me that the movie's plot can be, on the surface, so pro-life, and still not be something a good Catholic can really enjoy.I say ""on the surface"" because actually watching the movie takes work.  Juno herself is an unpleasant and unresponsible girl, with a decidedly critical and pessimistic view of the world around her, and it shows, because the movie is narrated by her inner monologue.  Still, this alone wouldn't be enough to ruin the film.  If I tried to count all the movie protagonists who start out foolish and irresponsible, and learn some important lesson by the end of the film, which turns their life around, I'd be too busy to make another review for the rest of my life.The problem is in the specifics.  You've probably heard that this movie contains profanity.  That's a whopping big understatement if I ever heard one.  This may be one of the most vulgar films I've ever seen, and as of right now, it's proof that they'll never give a movie an R rating for cursing alone.  I usually don't mind a little cursing in movies for the sake of realism, but this didn't feel realistic at all.  It felt over-the-top.  Maybe that was intentional.  Maybe they were trying to get a laugh that way.  I don't know.  I just know it didn't make me laugh.  The cover of the DVD claims that it's a comedy, but I didn't laugh once, at any point during the film, which is not a good sign.This movie, to its credit, tries to tackle all the hard sexual subjects of today; teen pregnancy, abortion, divorce, and so forth, but through it all, there's no real talk of honor or ethics, much less religion, and it seems to arrive at only about half the answers to the questions it poses.Nobody comes out and says ""what you did was wrong.""  There's no sense, from any of the characters, that their actions brought about consequences and they should take responsibility for them; just a mass of emotions over things like fingernails, body shape and lust.This sense of things being unfortunate, but never bad or wrong pervades the whole movie.  When Juno has sex out of wedlock, she's never told it was wrong.  When she decides against abortion, she never expresses that she thought it was wrong.  When the couple who plans to adopt her child decide to get a divorce, once again, that horrible word ""wrong"" never dares to rear its ugly head.  Even when the husband in that couple... acts unfaithfully, Juno never tells him that he's wrong to do so.  No one does.  Pish-tosh.  It just isn't done.  We don't say nasty words like that at the country club.Juno herself demonstrates many instances of poor judgment and simple bad morals early in the film, and never really seems to learn her lesson about them later.  In one instance, she expresses inner disgust over her boyfriend's mother for being overweight, and in another, makes a comment that sounds almost like a plug for gay adoption.  Bringing these things in, and failing to talk about whether they're wrong or right is simply a cop-out, and honestly, we deserve better.Ultimately, the strengths of this movie are found in the boyfriend, who, though shy and weak-willed, seems to genuinely care about Juno and want what's best for her, and in Juno herself, who gradually learns to appreciate that kind of love; the kind that involves making sacrifices.  It would be a mistake to say that these are not strengths.  They certainly are.However, the particular phrasing of the lesson that Juno learns is something like ""someone who loves you for who you really are,"" and this is a humanist moral lesson; not a Catholic one.  Love, by the Catholic definition, has nothing to do with who the person loved is, and everything to do with the person doing the loving.  It's a one-sided decision to do what is best for the other person, regardless of what kind of person they are, or how you may feel about them.Ultimately, I think that Juno might serve well to guide very self-centered people towards a better means of thinking, and as movies go, it doesn't stink, but if you're already a strong Catholic, don't waste your time on it.",3.0,0.0,2,4,0.0,neutral,0.9955,very positive,2011,5,6

Here, Ms. MacDonald plays the role of Sarah, a Victorian era, young Englishwoman who is about to enter into an arranged marriage with Harry, a stuffy Englishman.  Sarah also has a voice teacher named Karl (Nelson Eddy) with whom she makes beautiful music and falls in love. On practically the eve of her wedding, she and Karl declare themselves to each other and run away together to his native Vienna after getting hitched.There, she lives the impoverished life of a young wife happily married to a struggling composer, as Karl finishes writing his cherished operetta. While in Vienna, Sari, as Sarah is now called, makes the acquaintance of two individuals who are to have a great impact on her life, a rakish Baron and member of the Austrian Emperor's dashing Hussars (George Sanders) and a simpatico English Lord (Ian Hunter). Unfortunately, the Baron ultimately tries to seduce the unwilling Sari with catastrophic results.This film was understandably a flop, as it pales alongside this singing duo's other cinematic pairings. Jeanette MacDonald is radiant as always, but as she was nearly forty years old at the time, it is difficult to believe her in the role of  a young woman in her late teens. Nelson Eddy played the role of Karl as it he were in a state of near catatonic shock. It is hard to believe how he could sweep any woman off her feet, much less anyone as vivacious as Sarah.  In fact, the acting in his death scene was little different from that when playing the living Karl in love with the woman his dreams.George Sanders, however, is excellent as the scheming, villainous Baron, and Ian Hunter is charming in the role of the English Lord. Still, these two performances alone could not save a film that was doomed from the beginning by a weak screenplay, third rate music, and uneven performances. In fact, one of the scenes was downright embarrassing, with Jeanette MacDonald singing a dreadful song with a bizarre French accent. Moreover, the death scene was over in the blink of an eye, as if Nelson Eddy could not disappear from this film quickly enough. It was quite bizarre and totally lacking tension or cinematic fire. It was totally anti-climactic.This film was apparently based upon a Noel Coward operetta. Until I saw this film, I had no idea Noel Coward was a composer. Now I know why I had never heard of his music, if this is an example of it.  Still, those who are fans of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy will find some redeeming value in this sentimental mish-mosh.

He has no reservations about inflicting serious pain on people. He wants his wife, who has found Jesus and a respectable job, to go back to being a stripper.

We're quite familiar with what Henry VIII actually looked like. Poor little Jonathan Rhys Myers would be lost inside King Henry VIII's armor; what woeful miscasting. And in the opening scene with Henry administering pressure to his personal needs, Showtime shlock is demanded of Meyers and inflicted on viewers. The obligatory multitude of heaving bosoms is repetitive; the fine actors and audience deserve better. In the last Season, young Myers is crudely ""aged."" This isn't the actor's fault, but the director's, whose idea of an older Henry VIII has Meyers jutting his chin like an ersatz Orson Welles, grumbling, ""You shall have no wine before it's time."" Sadly, Meyers subsequently has been plagued by excesses of alcohol. Sam Waddington, the excellent actor who portrays Edward Stafford (an ancestor of my spouse, so I'm biased), the 3rd Duke of Buckingham, would have been a much more appropriate choice, though perhaps he wouldn't have submitted to Showtime's Henry-sleazy. Waddington is from the same area once dominated by the Plantagenet House of York. Unlike the story in ""The Tudors,"" the first conflict between the 3rd Duke of Buckingham and King Henry VIII regarded Henry's seduction of the Duke's sister, Anne Stafford, a conflict not explored in the series.The tragic Anne Boleyn, mother of Queen Elizabeth I, is masterfully played by Natalie Dormer, who shines in the role. There are stories behind stories with ""The Tudors."" Unfortunately, the creators of this series weren't particularly interested in depicting accurate events. Lady Margaret Pole (poorly depicted in ""The Tudors"") was persecuted by Henry VIII, her son in-law, the 1st Barron Stafford, was the son of the executed Edward Stafford, the 3rd Duke of Buckingham (Waddington). Stafford's mother was the daughter of the 4th Earl of Northumberland. Her nephew, Henry Percy, was said to have had an unfortunate secret marriage to Anne Boleyn. Later, he was forced to marry another woman, and was present at Anne's ""trial,"" after which he collapsed; dying a few months later.  Henry's hapless fifth wife, Katherine Howard (well-played by Tazmin Merchant), was Anne's first-cousin, the niece of Anne's mother (Katherine's father and Anne's mother were siblings). Henry couldn't leave the Howards alone. The depiction of the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk, Katherine's step-grandmother, who raised her, is oddly scewed.The worse Henry VIII's chance of providing legitimate male successors became, the more he pruned branches of the Plantagenet tree with more authentic claims to the throne than himself. Countess Salisbury, Lady Margaret Pole, was a lady-in-waiting to Catherine of Aragon, and governess to Princess Mary. Margaret's family was viciously persecuted by Henry VIII because they had many direct lines to the throne. Later, her son, Cardinal Reginald Pole, was the last Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury. Her daughter, Ursula (1504-1570), married Henry Stafford, the 1st Barron Stafford. His father (played by Sam Waddington) Edward Stafford, the 3rd Duke of Buckingham, is depicted with historical inaccuracies in the first episodes of ""The Tudors."" Buckingham was the great-great grandson of Edward the III. He had royal blood through Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester, Earl of Buckingham, younger son of Edward III, and brother of John of Gaunt; his mother, Catherine Woodville, was sister to Edward IV's queen, the lovely Elizabeth Woodville. These two sisters were descended from the de Luxembourg rulers of the Holy Roman Empire, and noble Orsini and de Balzo families.Lady Salisbury (Pole) was the eldest daughter of the George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, and the former Isabella Neville, elder daughter of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, and Anne Beauchamp, his wife, who inherited the Earldom of Warwick. George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, 1st Earl of Salisbury, 1st Earl of Warwick, (1449 - 1478) was the third son of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, and Cecily Neville. He was the brother of King Edward IV and King Richard III. His wife, Isabella, was the sister of Queen Anne, wife of King Richard III. George's mother, Cecily Neville, Duchess of York, was the daughter of Sir Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, and Joan Beaufort, daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, a Plantagenet, the 3rd surviving son of Edward the III, and father of Henry IV. These families were all interwoven.The arrest and brutal execution (considered grotesque even by that society's bloodthirsty standards) of Lady Margaret Pole (1473-1541) in ""The Tudors"" depicts her as cowardly. The historical record indicates her brave defiance and devout faith. For some reason, the show's writers transferred her execution onto Thomas Cromwell, perhaps to make him appear the larger martyr. Lady Salisbury was married to Sir Richard Pole (his mother, Edith St. John, was the half sister of King Henry VII's mother, Lady Margaret Beaufort). Her grandfather was Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, the ""Kingmaker,"" the wealthiest and most powerful English peer of his age, with international political connections, a main protagonist in the Wars of the Roses. The elder of his two daughters, Isabel, married George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence (daughter, Margaret Pole). Neville's younger daughter, Queen Anne, after a short-lived marriage to King Henry VI's son Edward of Westminster (who died young), married King Edward's younger brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who later became King Richard III. Anne was originally betrothed to Richard; he rescued her from captivity as George's ward. George wanted her massive inheritance in addition to her sister's.The depiction of the Catholic uprising, thePilgrimage of Grace: The Rebellion That Shook Henry VIII's Throne, has a bare minimum of detail; the Percy, Neville, and even Stafford families were deeply involved. This was a conflict between relatives about religious beliefs and power, whose outcome was fundamental to England; it would define who sat on the throne, a Tudor, or a Yorkist Plantagenet. Henry VIII, for all his foibles, sat triumphant in his sphere of assumed spiritual and political authority, largely due to all the family in-fighting  dating back toThe Wars of the Roses: A Bloody Crown.",3.0,0.8333333333333334,2,2,0.0,neutral,-0.9622,very negative,2012,7,3

56339,0783226748,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,0,0,2008-06-01,Van Damme & Moore: Quest Without A Compass,"When watching ""The Quest"", you can tell that Jean-Claude Van Damme's career was already in its mainstream descent: directed by himself, it's basically a retelling ofBloodsportwithout any and all cult intrigue and co-starring a way-past-his-prime Roger Moore who would go on to publicly blast his own involvement later on. Though I've never been a hardcore fan of Van Damme's, I'm always ready for a good action film - ""Quest"", however, is merely a bad film with good action scenes, remaining miles behind what the Muscles did earlier in his career before he decided to take up the reins himself.The story: Van Damme is Christopher Dubois, a 1920s pickpocket whose frequent run-ins with the law get him shanghaied on a smuggling ship from which he is ""rescued"" by a mercenary Englishman (Moore,The Spy Who Loved Me) who sells him into a Thai fighting circuit. The two inexplicably reunite and agree to aid eachother as they enter a Tibetan tournament pitting fighters from all over the world for the prize of a valuable golden statue.Let's get right to the good stuff, the fighting. In short, it's good but not great. The choreography of the encounters in the tournament (done by Peter Malota, returning fromDouble Impact) regularly surpasses that of ""Bloodsport"", with faster action that is just as hard-edged and fine representation of a wide variety of fighting styles. Notable combatants include a returning Abdel Qissi (Lionheart), pro wrestler Kitao Koji, Stefanos Miltsakakis (Bloodsport 4: The Dark Kumite), and Ong Soo Han (Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story). Disappointing is the length of most of these fights: with the exception of Van Damme's fisticuffs, each encounter is lucky if it lasts more than 20 seconds, even when the complete fight is filmed from start to finish.Sadly, the tournament only begins about halfway into the movie, and just about everything leading up to it is Van Damme's lackluster attempt at storytelling: it seems like he was going for something epic and character-driven, but despite its impressive scope, the film feels very compact and vanilla, and is populated by stock characters that don't grow on you. Some of them - like Janet Gunn (Carnosaur 3: Primal Species) as a worldly newspaper reporter, role Madonna turned down - feel practically forced on you because their prominence grossly exceeds their contributions to the story. Production values are sound, although that may be because a lot of the movie was shot on-location in places whose beauty speaks for itself.The repetitive use of slow motion during the fight scenes might irk others than me, but that's not going to bring down the film down even more if you already dislike it. While I enjoy the movie more than some of Van Damme's more universally-acclaimed features, ""Quest"" will give viewers plenty of time to use the bathroom or make popcorn before anything of note happens. Though fans will surely scoop this one right up, newcomers to Van Damme should save this film for later in their experience.",3.0,0.0,1,1,0.0,neutral,0.5468,positive,2008,6,1

Too many suckers fall for this kind of thing, when they see a special edition of their favourite movies, only to be disappointed. I'm disappointed, cos I couldn't even sit through the whole featurette, but I bought mine on the cheap. So it's not that big a loss. And lets face it, Whitney Houston's ""I Will Always Love You"" spent about 14 weeks (correct me if I'm wrong on that I'm just guessing) at the top of the UK charts, and I'm sick of seeing the video now. 13 years after the film was originally released would have warranted some decent extras. I suppose we'll have to wait until the 25th anniversary of this film to see if we get any decent DVD release - which so didn't happen with Grease, it's well past it's 25th anniversary, and still no special edition.Back to the film. I love this movie! The only thing that's stopping it from getting four stars is the dismal DVD release. It's so nice to see Whitney Houston the way she was, rather than the way she is now - talk about fame going to your head. She's never had a big a hit as she did with the aforementioned song, and that's been her downfall. The soundtrack album to this movie became one of the largest-selling soundtrack albums in history. To date, it has sold over 17 million copies. Sales were fueled by the success of the song ""I Will Always Love You"" which was written by Dolly Parton. According to Soundscan, the top-selling soundtrack was ""Saturday Night Fever"" album with 22 million albums sold to date.It's also my favourite Kevin Costner movie so far, as he's absolutely terrific in this. And for once, there's actually some chemistry between the two lead stars, which always helps towards a ""romantic comedy"".I would only recommend getting this so-called special edition DVD for very, very cheap.

839637,B0002L57XC,A15XTHGM4VS4WH,8,10,2005-05-03,Bad news for Modesty fans,"I'm sorry, I just couldn't like this movie, even though I wanted to. As a long-time fan of the Modesty Blaise books and comic strips I was really hoping that they had finally gotten it right, but my conclusion is that once again they've blown it.What worries me especially is that poor sales of this movie may result in Miramax deciding to drop the idea of making big-budget Modesty movies based on the books. And by the time Miramax's license expires (""My Name is Modesty"" was primarily made to allow Miramax to hold on to the license) it may be too late. We die-hard Modesty fans are getting up in years and movie studios don't make movies for an intended audience who lives in old folks homes.What was wrong with ""My Name is Modesty""? Primarily two things: the leading character was poorly cast and the script was embarrassingly bad.Alexandra Staden was unable to project the personality or presence necessary to be Modesty. An actress was needed who could make you feel that here was a person who had incredible self-assurance and self-control, and Alexandra Staden just didn't cut it.On top of that, Alexandra Staden didn't have the physique to be Modesty. Nor, in my opinion (but this is very subjective), the attractive good looks.The story was also very poor. They decided that they wanted some kind of prequel movie where Modesty would be introduced. What they came up with was a film with a very contrived here-and-now story that provided a vehicle for a large number of flashbacks to Modesty's past. But neither the story of Modesty's background nor the here-and-now story work very well.In the background story the most important person is Lob, an old man who Modesty befriends and who becomes her tutor, teaching her everything most children learn in school and much more. Lob was a professor who spoke seven languages and had extensive knowledge of many things. So far so good - this is consistent with the books about Modesty.But in the movie Lob is also a martial arts guru who has killed two prison guards! And yet 12-year-old Modesty has to save him from a couple of rag-tag boys who try to steal from him! Sorry, but it just doesn't work, both because it's inconsistent and because the idea of Lob being both the intellectual mentor and the martial arts teacher is too far out. (In the books Lob was totally helpless without Modesty, and Modesty first learned unarmed combat at a later time in her life.)As for the current story, Modesty is apparently the casino owner's right-hand man, but without any indication of how or why she got this position. Miklos (the bad guy) shows up with a gang of heavily armed nasties, kills a couple of people just to prove that he is indeed the bad guy, and then sits around all night listening to Modesty tell tales of her childhood! How unrealistic and contrived can you get?With the above problems going against it the film just doesn't make the grade.The film was shot in only 18 days in Hungary and is very obviously a low-budget film. This I don't hold against it - if the casting of Modesty had been better and the script wasn't so dumb I would have accepted the low-budget aspect as an unfortunate fact of life and lauded the film within it's limitations.Strangely enough, the thing I liked best about ""My Name is Modesty"" was the casting of Miklos, the bad guy. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau had an impossible role to play because of the poor script but he did a good job, better than Alexandra Staden's portrayal of Modesty. In fact, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau could have been a fairly good Willie Garvin. (Willie Garvin is Modesty's trusted sidekick, who enters her life a couple of years after the events shown in this movie).The DVD includes a 50-minute interview with Peter O'Donnell, the now-retired creator of the Modesty Blaise character and author of the books and comic strips. He tells again the very moving story about his meeting with the real-life little girl who later inspired him to create Modesty Blaise. (His telling of the story is much more moving than the re-enactment that we see at the beginning of this movie.)The DVD also includes a 40-minute interview with Quentin Tarantino, a long-time Modesty fan who is the driving force behind Miramax getting the movie rights to the character. There is also an extensive index to all of the Modesty comic strips.Despite me giving only three stars I'm recommending this movie if you're a Modesty fan. If not, then it's best to avoid it.Rennie Petersen",3.0,0.8,1,1,-0.5423,negative,0.5672,positive,2005,5,3
1293843,B002VKE0XA,A3DV7AKNM4N8TN,1,2,2011-04-03,So many ghost stories so little time,"Paranormal was a smash hit that was first created and shown at fests throughout 2007 but only got it's theatrical release in 2009. Oren Peli both wrote and directed this film which is nothing short of a breakout success with how much attention and money he has made off of it with such an amazingly low production budget. Love it or hate it you have to give Oren credit for being able to create a film that has outdone almost everything out there on the ratio for the profit margin - it honestly wasn't a bad film either.While it's a movie that suffers from being unable to sit through multiple viewings (at least anywhere near each other), being horribly spoiled by audiences knowing what to expect going into it, and many other things that come from a low budget movie's big screen success - it was still a great film. When I sat down for my first screening of the film it actually wasn't prior to a theatrical release and I'm glad I didn't have to watch it as a screener copy though possibly at a convention would have been cool. As I sat down you could feel a buzz going through the audience as it was a showing for all horror fans (about a month before a wide release was announced.) The entire crowd had heard amazing things about it and this was before the marketing machine had crept in and managed to dull the feeling of the film many have missed out on.The entire film consists of 8 characters even though the majority only focuses on the couple Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat.) I love how the majority of the cast has the characters retain the same name as the actors who play them. It's setup to show the couple as being completely realistic and also sets Katie up as having a chance at being a real scream queen if a few casting agents take notice as she really is able to belt it out. As I was saying the couple's interactions for the most part are completely realistic (though Micah's insistence at about the half way mark of the movie to still figure it all out on his own get's a bit tiresome.) People who don't believe in ghosts aren't going to believe that a person can be haunted and try to poke at it to come up with a rational answer which is exactly what Micah does. Katie who knows she is haunted just wants to leave it be as provoking it always makes it worse.The movie has a very slow build up which can hurt it with audiences who have no patience in their movies though the buildup brings up quite a few mind blowing moments of suspense for those who do like a slow start. They are able to capture exactly what makes our cast so afraid of going to bed at night. It's an amazing achievement to be able to get a crowd react so much to purely suspense and not scares in a film and something that is mainly a lost art in Hollywood. Too many people enjoy instant payoffs so the slow buildup has been overlooked for years - Paranormal Activity shows that this is still a valid art form in the realm of making horror.",3.0,0.5,1,2,-0.3774,negative,0.9684,very positive,2011,4,3

Anyone who has done any genuine research into the history of the series will know she was not dropped because of poor acting ability, her appearance or any of the other harsh and sometimes cruel stories that have been circulating over the years. It was partially a production decision on behalf of the network and because of some very difficult personal problems in her life. It would have been interesting to see her character develop, but dreadful writing and sad circumstances prevented that from ever happening. With that said, this episode is a sad reflection on a very interesting idea gone completely wrong. As with &quot;Plato's StepChildren&quot;, this episode is among the worst in being overdone in terms of acting and production.

Unfortunately, ""The Sanctuary"" cannot keep with the level of intensity of opening action, soon losing steam before it enters the main story.The story quickly moves to the present day. Mike B plays Krit, a young man selling fake relics to tourists. The story is a familiar one, about an ordinary person who gets involved with a group of gangsters and assassins led by a baddie played by smirking Russell Wong. With a help from a beautiful grad student Praifa (Intira Jaroenpura), Krit must save the stolen royal antiques before they are brought outside the country. Well, just like the hero of ""Ong-Bak.""I don't care if the story is terribly disjointed. I enjoyed ""Ong-Bak"" and ""Chocolate"" anyway. Strangely, Krit has a twin brother Kirk, played by Mike B again, but he unceremoniously disappears.

1076541,B000QQFKYE,A30QSLHX2HC9GE,2,5,2008-12-06,It's like a nightmare captured on film.,"INLAND EMPIRE is pretty similar to other David Lynch films like LOST HIGHWAY and MULHOLLAND DRIVE because it sort of alternates between two different worlds, both of which are almost the exact opposite of each other. And INLAND EMPIRE is similar to most David Lynch movies in that you don't know WHAT the Hell is going on half the time. So with that being said, I'm not really sure what INLAND EMPIRE is about and considering I've only seen it ONCE, it would be unfair to make any assumptions. I tried to follow along, take notes, and piece the clues together while watching the movie, but within an hour I gave up and decided to just watch it. Also the fact that the film is three hours long, made me want to just get it over with.INLAND EMPIRE is basically a movie within a movie and it starts off somewhat normal. Nikki (Laura Dern) accepts a role in a movie that co-stars a handsome womanizing actor named Devon (Justin Theroux). As the film's production starts they find out that they are actually filming a REMAKE of a movie that had its production halted due to a murder involving the actors. There are also hints that Devon wants to add Nikki to his list of women that he's conquered, but he denies it. Nikki is already married, but there's sort of a tension between them and as they get closer and actually show affection, INLAND EMPIRE does a complete 180 and goes off into bizarre territories that only David Lynch could provide. It all starts when the line between Nikki's reality and the movie that she's filming, completely blurs. And YOU, as the viewer, don't even know if you're watching Nikki (the real character) or Susan, the character that she's portraying in her movie. After that, INLAND EMPIRE alternates between Nikki's world, which is one of luxury, and another world that's dirty and ugly and revolves around some sort of murder. There's also a lingering theme of prostitution. And again much like MULHOLLAND DRIVE, there's another woman that's introduced but you don't know if she's a completely different character, if she represents Nikki, or if she actually IS Nikki. As if the character that she plays (Susan) has jumped out of her script and come to life. Or maybe you're getting a glimpse into the world of the lead actors who were murdered during the original production of the film that Nikki is starring in. Confused yet?? I'll stop there...Well, if you're a David Lynch fan you'll probably like this. Personally, I'm a huge Lynch fan. I enjoyed INLAND EMPIRE because it's just so weird that it's almost refreshing to watch. But I have to admit that it's definitely not one of my favorite Lynch films. It's interesting but it's not breaking any new grounds as far as Lynch's filmography goes and is too similar to some of his other films.The DVD:The quality of the film is horrible, but knowing David Lynch that was probably his intention so all I will say is that it's not a pretty film by any means. The overall quality looks really low budget, is shaky at times (hand held cameras), and parts of the movie look generations old. The lighting also makes it difficult to see in some parts. However, despite the bad quality, the actual SHOTS in the film are beautiful and Lynch shows that he really knows how to create both gorgeous scenes and incredibly ugly scenes (or sometimes both mixed together), ultimately creating a nightmarish effect.The EXTRA FEATURES: MORE THINGS THAT HAPPENED (74:55) - Basically a bunch of deleted scenes that are all edited together so that you have to watch them as a whole. It's almost like watching a different version of the movie. I didn't watch it all because by the time I got done with INLAND EMPIRE, I was pretty Lynch-ed out if you know what I mean.QUINOA (20:03) - David Lynch shows you how to cook his favorite dish called Quinoa, which is like a bunch of protein mixed with broccoli or something. It's really weird. It sounds like someone actually went out of their way to SCORE footage of David cooking. In between, he tells a weird story and randomly makes these weird gestures with his hands similar to what Dennis Hopper did in BLUE VELVET.BALLERINA (12:19) - Edited footage of a ballerina dancing to music. You see glimpses of her toward the end of INLAND EMPIRE and I guess this is just a polished product of footage that was shot with her.STORIES (41:37) - David Lynch sitting down and telling stories about the filming of INLAND EMPIRE.LYNCH 2 (30:10) - My favorite Extra Feature on the DVD. It's basically real Behind-the-Scenes footage of INLAND EMPIRE, seen through the eyes (or lens) of someone who just follows David Lynch around the set. It's like they edited together a bunch of his weird antics. The footage mostly consists of Lynch yelling at cast and crew, getting hands on with the production (making props, etc.), going over scripts, making phone calls, and other random stuff. It's very entertaining.3 stars",3.0,0.4,1,2,0.3612,positive,0.9674,very positive,2008,12,6

It is soon established that realism isn't much of a concern, as persons unknown attempt to hijack a truck making a run from Georgia to New Jersey.In a tragic accident, big rig driver Jack Crews (the late Patrick Swayze) struck and killed some people with his truck.  After doing time for manslaughter, and losing his truckers license, Crews now works as a mechanic.  Financially strapped, Crews accepts a job offered by his employer Mr. Cutler (Graham Beckel), to make an illegal run up from Atlanta.  Unknown to Crews, the truck is loaded with a shipment of weapons, and is the subject of a joint FBI and ATF investigation.Down in Georgia, Red (Meat Loaf) the Bible quoting owner of R & H Trucking, lays down the law.  Crews and Earl (Randy Travis) will be in the rig, escorted by a blue Camaro containing Sonny (Gabriel Casseus) and Wes (Brain Vincent) as backup.  The crew are on the road for a short time, when the first attempt to hijack the load occurs.  Things get extreme really fast, as Crews leaves dead men and burning wreckage in his wake.  Discovering that the shipment includes assault weapons, hardens Crew's determination not to be stopped, but the stakes get even higher, when his wife (Brenda Strong), and daughter are taken hostage.Once momentum is established, the level of violence remains high up through the finish.  Most of the action is vehicular, as cars, trucks, and motor cycles, bang, bump, skid, crash, spin, flip, and explode.  The stunts and action are the high points of the film, and they are for the most part, nicely executed.  The unstoppable truck has the starring role, and runs over, crushes, and obliterates, whatever gets in the way.  Swayze and Travis make a pretty good team, while Charles Dutton and Stephen Tobolowsky head up the law enforcement side.  Meat Loaf as the fanatical Red, and the wild-eyed Beckel as Cutler, make shallow, but colorful villains.A straightforward action feature with bone-jarring hits, and heavy doses of vehicular destruction, Black Dog delivers a truckload of mindless fun.",3.0,0.6666666666666666,6,1,0.0,neutral,-0.9705,very negative,2010,7,21

By Contrast, ""American Outlaws"" (2001) details the James-Younger Gang's first year in action and makes the Old West fun, heroic and larger-than-life and 2007's ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" is a serious Western drama.

833887,B0002HS74C,A4FX5YCJA630V,4,6,2007-03-17,"""You Have to Believe that there are People Who Love You...""","Depending on your tastes and preferences, the forth season of ""Angel"" (chronicling the adventures of the vampire-with-a-soul in Los Angeles), is the season where the show finally hit its stride, or began to go belly-up. For the past three seasons the episodes have been rather episodic; as part of a supernatural organization that investigates paranormal phenomena (with vampire-slaying on the side) Angel and his team; ex-cheerleader and present-seer Cordelia Chase, intellectual scholar Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, former street-kid Charles Gunn, karaoke-demon Lorne and physicist Winifred ""Fred"" Burkle, who spent five years trapped in a demon-dimension, have all joined together to form a surrogate family and fight the good fight against the forces of evil.But Season Three introduced several new components into the mix; predominantly that of Conner, Angel's teenage son. Born out of a mysterious union between two vampires (Angel and Darla; a seemingly impossible occurrence) Conner was kidnapped by an old foe of Angel, taken to a demon dimension and returned in what was years for Conner, but mere weeks for Angel and the gang. Disillusioned and bitter towards his father, the season ended with Conner turning on Angel and sinking him to the bottom of the ocean in an iron box. Meanwhile, Cordelia was taken in a quite different direction; after the pain of her physic visions became too great for her to bear and she was made part-demon, she ascended into a higher plane of existence in the season finale. With Angel and Cordelia missing, Lorne off to Las Vegas, and Wesley estranged from the group, Fred and Gunn are left to run the detective agency on their own.With the group split up, the first prerogative of Season Four is to reunite all our main characters. Without giving away too many details, we eventually get our gang together again, with one major problem: Cordelia is returned to them without any memory of her life - and perhaps something else is wrong with her too. In attempting to restore the lost affection and dynamics within his self-created family, Angel embarks on a personal quest to restore his son, his love and his friends to him. This is a little tricky what with the latest apocalypse hitting L.A., complete with fire falling from the sky, an eclipse blotting out the sun, and a giant beast stalking the streets of the city.Season Four boasts a cohesive and intricate storyline, in which practically each episode picks up directly after the one before. Expectations are continuously undercut, there are twists and turns galore, every character gets their dark side tapped into, and we get plenty of treats: the return of Faith (not seen since a brief cameo in season two of ""Angel""), the return of Angelus, the surprising deaths of a few major characters (not that that's technically a *good* thing, but it's always good when a show isn't afraid to use death as a legitimate consequence), a cameo role from Willow (Alyson Hannigan) and some really nifty special effects - although they did go a bit overboard on the slow-motion scenes.Angel's extended family has always been a bit more tempestuous than the Scooby Gang on its sister-show ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". When Buffy fights with her friends, it tends to get resolved by the end of the episode. When Angel's friends fight, it can be several weeks before reconciliation is made, and as such Angel's desperation to keep his loved ones together (and more often than not, failing in this respect) is heart-rending. This season also brings the subject of fate to the forefront, a theme that has run throughout all previous seasons (and even back into the third season of ""Buffy"" - think back to the snowfall in the pivotal-episode ""Amends"" - who do you think was responsible for it now?) This age-old question that hangs over humanity; whether we are subject to fate or in control of our own destinies - is handled with incredible depth. In the black void that is mindless Hollywood movies these days, it's good to know that lowly television shows can tap into the human psyche and condition. Does the loss of free will justify world peace? Are we bound by fate or do we have a choice? Is the saving of many lives worth the sacrifice of one innocent one? Just a few questions that the show raises and deals with in mature and surprising ways.On the other hand, there were several elements of this season that didn't mesh well, much to the distress of the fans. The relationship of Angel and Cordelia has always been the backbone of the show, and their platonic friendship has been a delight to watch develop over the course of three seasons. Unfortunately, making Angel romantically interested in Cordelia opens up a whole new can of worms (the least of which is how Angel planned to pursue any kind of long-term relationship with Cordelia when he is a vampire, and she isn't; not to mention Buffy, his son, his immortality, and the curse on his soul that has dire consequences should he ever experience a moment of true happiness). The fact that the writers ignored every single one of these factors in their treatment of the relationship was frustrating to say the least, resulting in the taking of the strongest platonic male/female friendship on either show (I don't count Willow/Xander/Buffy considering their friendship began as a love triangle) and turning it into a weird and twisted Oedipal mess. Maybe I'm just watching the wrong shows, but I'm constantly annoyed to find a complete lack of straight male/female platonic friendships on television. It is possible to love someone of the opposite sex without falling in love with them - Angel and Cordelia were the perfect example of this till Season Four.Ruining the established friendship between the two of them by forcing them into a romantic relationship one was of several odd choices made in the latter half of the season, along with turning the potentially tragic figure of Conner into a whiny teenager and pulling a three-sixty with Cordelia's character. Apparently actress Charisma Carpenter's unannounced pregnancy threw a spanner in the works for the writers of the show, forcing them to introduce a new antagonist for the Gang to fight whilst rendering Cordelia incapacitated - ultimately resulting in Charisma's exclusion from Season Five.But of course, this is all my opinion. From another point of view, all these elements could be seen as the best parts of the season - that's the tricky thing about writing reviews, they are entirely subjective! And for all its flaws, there were some undeniably fantastic elements: the use of Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, taking the once-comic figure into a new realm of darkness, the epic quality that the show began to take, the character development that Gunn and Fred (finally!) get, and a season finale that foreshadows the possibilities of Season Five with a strange new opportunity for Angel and the gang to take...",3.0,0.6666666666666666,1,3,0.6369,very positive,0.9967,very positive,2007,3,17

307009,6302309751,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,1,3,2006-05-30,The Sinbad Series Went Past Its Prime,"I am a big fan of Ray Harryhausen, the man who created the marvelous special effects for movies such as ""It Came from Beneath the Sea"" and ""20 Million Miles to Earth.""  I have enjoyed nearly every movie for which Ray Harryhausen has created special effects and the special effects in all them.  Unfortunately this movie, one of the last movies with Harryhausen special effects, is also one of the weakest movies for which Harryhausen has done special effects.Sinbad (Patrick Wayne, a veteran of dozens of television appearances) is a questing man, and this time he meets hot babe Princess Farah (played by a young and gorgeous Jane Seymour) and her baboon brother Prince Kassim (played sometimes by a stop-action baboon and the rest of the time by Damien Thomas).  Of course, Prince Kassim is not supposed to be a baboon, but the only way to get him back to human form is to find Melanthius (played by Dr. Who veteran Patrick Troughton).  Melanthius determines that the only way to change Prince Kassim back is to head off to the arctic to some mysterious power, taking beautiful blonde daughter Dione (Taryn Power) with him.Of course, quests like these are no fun unless there is someone chasing after you.  In this case the person is Zenobia (Margaret Whiting), who wants her son Rafi (Kurt Christian) to become the king.  Zenobia has power of her own, which we figure out quickly when we learn that she is the one who turned Prince Kassim into a baboon.  Zenobia decides to make Sinbad's trip more interesting by animating a Minoton, which looks a lot like a robot Minotaur.Sinbad and gang head off to the frigid north, encountering a giant wasp, a really giant walrus, a one-horned giant troglodyte, assorted ghouls, and (what was missing from the list?) a saber-toothed tiger!  It's a tough journey, especially with Princess Farah and Dione exposing all sorts of flesh as they go skinny-dipping, but Sinbad will overcome all obstacles to save Prince Kassim!The problem with this movie is that the acting is not all that great, and the plot seems too much like a re-tread of the previous two Sinbad movies.  I enjoy the special effects, but I also knew too far in advance when things were going to happen.  Admittedly, that knowledge comes after having watched every Ray Harryhausen movie in existence, but even a viewer who has watched the previous two Sinbad movies will find this one predictable.As with the two previous movies, this DVD contains extras.  ""This Is Dynamation"" and ""The Ray Harryhausen Chronicles"" were included in ""The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad.""  Both features are great for fans of Harryhausen.  There are some additional goodies, such as trailers, production notes and talent files.There is a lot to recommend in this movie.  Harryhausen's stop-action work is always remarkable and always a treat.  Jane Seymour and Taryn Power are lovely eye candy.  For the women there is hunky Patrick Wayne, the second son of Hollywood macho man John Wayne.  If you have the previous two Sinbad movies, ""The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad"" and ""The Golden Voyage of Sinbad,"" then you have to have this movie to complete the set.

This show reminds me of a soap opera with pretty people who are really not all that great at acting but are just pretty to look at.The only reason I am giving Spartacus three stars is because I enjoy animation. But it is not as good as 300. In terms of picture quality and animation it is several notches well below the movie 300. Some of the fight scenes look pretty amazing but that is not enough to make me watch this entire series let alone buy the DVD collection.The women are overdone with too much makeup and perfectly coiffed hair. It diminishes all semblance of authenticity as to how women were back then.Honestly, for me it is something I would watch with the sound off. Actually, all I would really like to do is cut the fight scenes, play them back to back in their slow motion graphically altered state (and throw in my own added music track - something thrasher-like) and use it as a screen saver for my computer.

Bastian is no longer threatened by bullies, but is instead taunted by his classmates when he joins the dive team.  His father (John Wesley Shipp) misguidedly prods Bastian into overcoming his fears.  Frustrated, Bastian returns to Mr. Koreander's bookstore and though he is warned that the story in ""The Neverending Story"" doesn't remain the same, Bastian borrows the book and ends up returning to Fantasia.  Upon entering Fantasia, Bastian finds that he has the symbol of the childlike Empress, Auryn, around his neck.  He is informed by the giant bird Nimbly (Martin Umbach) that anytime he makes a wish, the power in Auryn will make the wish come true.  However, there is a dark secret to Auryn.  To save Fantasia, Bastian must find out Auryn's secret, defeat the evil witch Xayide, and stop the Emptiness from consuming Fantasia.The original film version of THE NEVERENDING STORY was a decent adaptation of Michael Ende's novel, but unfortunately only told half the story.  THE NEVERENDING STORY II takes elements from the second-half of Ende's novel, but only uses them as plot points to tell a completely different story.I remember watching THE NEVERENDING STORY II in theatres and finding myself a bit let down.  There is a great deal of excitement to capture the imagination of children (I'll never forget the way Bastian solves his dilemma--it's a choice worthy of Solomon).  Nevertheless, the overall plot and structure of the film is much weaker.  After having first viewed the film, the most memorable thing I remember taking out of it was that Flash (John Wesley Shipp) and that cool kid actor (Jonathan Brandis) were in it.  Over fifteen years later, those are probably the things that people will most remember from the movie.Recommended for children who enjoy fantasy or for those who like to see how Hollywood screwed up the chance to make a wonderful sequel.",3.0,1.0,5,2,0.0,neutral,0.9565,very positive,2007,8,10

This is evident in ""May"", which by and large is ""the little horror movie that could', but ends up with a couple of flaws that makes it ultimately disappointing.  Namely, (1) the lesbian subplot was too over-the-top and stood out poorly against the rest of the movie, and I wonder if it was stuck in there just to cater to the lesbian-fetish crowd; and (2) May's ""snap"" into a murderous fugue state was too sudden and implausible; she went from this insecure fragile waif to an invulnerable scaupel-wielding mistress in the blink of an eye.Still, the movie worth checking out, and if you're a horror fan who's less critical than me you'll probably love it.  The violence makes you cringe, the application of music (and lack thereof) is really fabulous, and the killings are nicely understated and anti-dramatic in such a way that makes genre-hugging horror films look ridiculous.

403922,6304142137,A2PBV1899CX3TE,1,2,2008-07-02,The Truth About The Truth About Cats & Dogs,"This movie is a romcom, AKA romantic comedy, and the twist is that the smart, short girl gets the guy, not the tall blonde model, Noelle (Uma Thurman). Dr. Abby Barnes (Janeane Garofalo) is a veterinarian with a call in radio show, but low self esteem when it comes to men. Brian (Ben Chaplin) is a caller with a dog problem. He got a big dog from the pound for a photo shoot, and put the pooch on roller skates. The dog is destroying the house, but he can't get him off the skates. Abby talks him through it, and he ends up bonding with the dog. He tries to arrange a face-to-face meeting, to thank her, and also, because he is attracted to her. Duh. She doesn't show up for the rendezvous, but then a series of seemingly random events conspire to make him think that Abby's attractive neighbor Noelle is the woman he has been speaking to.Janeane is used to playing the friend. In Reality Bites, she was really a hoot, but the story focused on Winona Ryder. She was just the back story, an after thought, really. Even though she had a lot going on, it was all Winona, Winona, Winona. In this film, however, they really get you to be more interested in Abby, and Noelle is cute and a nice if not too bright person, but she is so boring that you are really more attracted to Abby, and you don't even notice that they never even tie the loose ends up with Noelle and the jerks she dates, like Roy. Maybe she could've hooked up with Ed (Jamie Foxx), Brian's friend. I'm surprised that she didn't hook up with anyone, but the story is really about Brian and Abby, and they live happily ever after (or don't, just so I am not spoiling the end for anyone who hasn't seen this).This is a well made romcom and I wasn't asking too much of it, but neither was I disappointed. Garofalo wise cracks her way through with much aplomb, but seeing her jokes on paper, they aren't nearly as funny. Guess it is just her deadpan delivery and comic timing. Another thing I will say is that they handled the preposterous plot well, and didn't just get sloppy and think, who cares? This is just a romcom. Preposterous, yes, but plausible the way it was filmed, and they never ignore the laws of physics or violate the time-space continuum.The movie also has cute cats & dogs. Abby has a cat that looks just like my cat, Felix. A fluffy black and white cat with a cute black nose. Hank is the big dog that Brian adopts. Hank is kind of like Marmaduke, the dog in the newspaper comics. It was good, but I am only giving it 3 stars.$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$Uma Thurman .... NoelleThe Accidental Husband (2008) ....

68041,0783240031,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,2,4,2000-04-19,Everyone's marriage nightmare come true,"This is a disturbing, bittersweet romantic comedy about two people whose 15 year marriage is unraveling. Actually, it is more of a romantic tragedy than a comedy. Ben and Katie Jordan (Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer)  are two mismatched people in the marriage that never should have been. He  is spontaneous, romantic and impulsive, with low frustration tolerance and  an explosive hair trigger temper. She is pragmatic, a compulsive  perfectionist with unrealistic expectations, and a high need for control.  She takes everything personally and never forgives or forgets a slight.  They both blame each other for their disappointments. The pattern is clear.  He doesn't meet her standards so she snipes, he explodes and then she  accuses him of not listening. She then throws up every mistake he's ever  made and every fault he's ever had. This goes on ad nauseam as their  romantic obsession with one another continues to get the best of any sense  they might have to call it quits. Like moths to a flame, they keep  returning for another scorching.This film is thought provoking in that  it portrays marital difficulties that are all too familiar in our society.  The problem is that it tries to give every problem known to man (with the  exception of wife beating) to this couple and relies on the single strand  of a long forgotten romance to be the only chance of keeping them  together.In watching the behind the scenes featurette on this film, Rob  Reiner and writers Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson discuss how the story  evolved. As it turns out, it was a montage of all their own marital  problems. So the film was, in essence cathartic dumping ground for the  writers and director.As filmmaking, it was terrific. Rob Reiner weaves  the story together expertly, creating a stark contrast between the joy of  the romance and the reality of the relationship. The film was punctuated by  numerous funny and sweet moments that make the viewer smile and glow with  delight.Michelle Pfeiffer gives a splendid performance of a very  emotionally complex and neurotic character. It took a lot of courage for  her to take this part because she was playing the least likeable character  in the film, something of a departure for her. Bruce Willis was as good as  one could have expected considering the fact that nobody was blowing  anything up. Actually, he was quite good as the impulsive, childlike  romantic, but when it came to the arguments and the serious displays of  resentment, he played the scenes too harshly, almost commando  style.Reiner does good camera work and puts together some good rapid  fire scenes that have impact and give great insight into the relationship.  He also took the film on location in Venice to add a little romantic  interlude, and somehow got Eric Clapton to write a great theme song.The  problem is the story. Reiner stated in the featurette that he intended this  to be a realistic bittersweet look at the real problems relationships face.  But he tried to do too much and made this film a grossly exaggerated  caricature of a relationship in crisis. It is really &quot;The War of The  Roses&quot; lite only it takes itself too seriously. No one I know who saw  this could believe that this couple could possibly have stayed married for  15 weeks, no less 15 years.The result is a noxious marathon of petty  arguments that get under the viewers' skin after a while. It is about as  entertaining as watching your best friends have a niggling argument in a  public restaurant. The whole thing leaves you very uncomfortable and you  don't go home feeling like you've had a nice evening.So, while it  succeeds as filmmaking, it fails as a film. I gave this film a 6/10. There  were so many good elements to it that I can't see trashing it. But the  story is one that requires a level of emotional endurance that few viewers  will be willing or able to invest to get any enjoyment out of it.",3.0,0.5,3,1,0.4215,positive,0.9191,very positive,2000,4,19

In the movie, Fox traveled from Kansas to New York City to make his success and fortune. He stumbled along the way and ended up with a mailroom job (thanks to his long-lost Uncle and CEO) at a major corporation. I can relate to that as I used to have a mailroom job, but I didn't have such an uncle. In any case, it soon got somewhat more hard to believe in that he became a self-motivated corporate freelancer and set up his domain in a vacant office and managed to procure loads of supplies and his own secretary. He also met Helen Slater, a lower-level corporate executive and Harvard graduate,  and was smitten. That's understandable, the smitten part. Then things started to get wild. Too wild, really. The early part of the movie introduced the characters and it was rather interesting. I was looking forward to settling in to a good comedy. The latter part of the movie decayed into a farce.Fox got seduced by the bosses wife (remember, the boss was his uncle) and his boss seduced his new-found and potential girlfriend (Slater), an employee. Things started to get complicated. Real complicated. Eventually, everyone attended  a large company gathering. Seducers and seducees are totally intermingled. Oh, I forgot. The boss thought  his nephew was a mail-room employee, as he was hired, and had no idea that he was a self-appointed corporate executive going under a different name and had somehow risen into the upper corporate ranks. The whole thing was a total fiasco and probably most people would find it to be hilariously funny. I didn't. The more complex it became, the more tedious it became. Toward the end, I just wanted to turn the whole farce off.Gary Peterson",3.0,0.0,1,1,0.5106,positive,-0.121,neutral,2012,4,16

But Diesel, a tough guy who has been trained to take on the baddest dudes imaginable (and a man with apparently only one t-shirt to his name), finds he has gotten more than he bargained for in this latest assignment.""The Pacifier"" pretty much goes straight for all the garden variety, lowbrow slapstick routines one would expect from such a corny setup.  Yet, the movie generates a surprising number of genuinely charming moments, thanks mainly to Vin Diesel himself who, though still not an actor, manages to convey a certain befuddled innocence that works well in this part.  There are some perfectly awful scenes in the closing stretches that work hard to erase much of the goodwill the movie has managed to generate up to that point, but if you can look past the badness and you're in a forgiving mood, you might not hold them against the entire film.  When all is said and done, it's not really much of a movie, but it's at least better than the genuinely dreadful ""Daddy Day Care"" and the two ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" films.And I sure would like to know what magical spot-removal product Diesel used to get that mustard stain out of that white t-shirt.

Fun, fluffy, innocent and lively movie with wonderfully appealing performances by Sarah Jessica Parker and Helen Hunt. I had this on VHS and DVD, and was so excited to find out that it was coming to blu ray...I pre-ordered it that very day.Now, for my disappointment in the blu ray release.There's no reason for the upgrade from DVD. The same specks, scratches and dirt appear in the film, so no cleanup was done. The sound is a BIT better than the DVD, but not much. And the extras? Only a trailer that is curiously incomplete in comparison to the DVD one. I watched the trailer and immediately noticed something was odd about it on the blu ray...during a couple of moments, the screen went totally black, yet there was still audio..then there was nothing whatsoever with the title of the movie in the trailer. I pulled out my DVD and sure enough, it was different. During the blank spots on the blu ray, the DVD would flash the word ""Girls"" in light blue neon...and at the end of the trailer was the title with the credits. What would possibly be the reason for omitting this from the blu ray trailer???? It's the TITLE OF THE MOVIE! Just very odd....Anyway, I still love the movie, but I do not see a reason for anyone to upgrade to blu if they already have the DVD (UNLESS you have the version of the DVD that was 1:33 aspect ratio...the previous DVD release was 1:85, as is the blu ray).Side note: What is with the horribly photo-shopped cover?

883728,B0007NFLO0,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,1,2,2010-05-08,Just another serial killer movie...?,"(Beware of semi-spoilers.)Another serial killer movie...  I can't believe I watched the whole thing.  Well, it stars Ben Kingsley, one of the outstanding actors of our time, and he does a good job; and Aaron Eckhart, one of the most underrated actors of our time; and the intriguing Carrie-Anne Moss whom you may recall from The Matrix films.The gimmick here is that the serial killer is obsessive-compulsive.  Well, it seems that way.  We are shown massive numbers of sick black and white line-drawings done presumably by the serial killer and massive amounts of numerals up and down the page, on drinking glasses, all over the map of the US, etc.  I mean this dude is obsessed, and as FBI agent sent to the hinterlands, Thomas Mackelway (Eckhart) says, he is smarter than us.  Love those genius serial killers.But wait.  Let's not jump to conclusions.  Even though we see Kingsley from the very beginning seemingly doing some very bad deeds, maybe, just maybe, that isn't the whole story.  And anyway Eckhart clearly is a bit of a loose cannon.  He was suspended for six months.  So let's just keep viewing and see what happens.Okay, why am I bothering to write a review about an American obsession, about some Hollywood types trying to make a buck?  Do I want to write yet another review on just how sick the audience is that craves this stuff?  (And, after all, I watched the whole thing, although I must say in my defense that (1) this is not as gruesome as some other serial killer movies (sorry); and (2) I mostly turned away when they showed the bodies; and (3) Eckhart, Kingsley and Moss are very good.)  Do I want to say yet again, how sick is it to exploit the human weakness for watching this stuff?  I mean, humans understandably are fascinated with death in all its forms and rightly so since knowledge about how death can occur, especially violent death, might be valuable.  Such knowledge probably was valuable in the prehistory when our emotions were formed.Anyway, what I really want to say in this review is what a shame it is that Kingsley, Eckhart and Moss have to waste their talent on something like this just to make a living.  But this is the sadness of movies.  How few, how very few, are really works of art or at least attempts at being works of art.  Instead we have entertainments, seductions of the audience, emotional manipulations and so on.  Seeing the bigger picture we realize that a serial killer movie is no worse than teen angst BS, or black exploitation, or uplifting, feel-good alien cartoons, or revenge, ""make my day"" dramas, or chick flicks, or musicals or any of the one hundred and one standard Hollywood commercial ventures.But I was thinking as I watched this: could this inspire young minds (or deranged older minds) to kill?  How about some poor smuck who desperately longs to be Somebody?  Might not this give him some sick inspiration?It might, but I suspect if I interviewed director E. Elias Merhige and asked him that question he would say something like, ""Whoa, dude.  Did you not notice that the bad guys got their just deserts in the end?  Does that always happen these days?  I think not.  So cut me some slack.  And besides, where is it written that I have to make some kind of socially correct movie?  As soon as I am told what themes I am allowed or not allowed to pursue it's the same as censorship.  You may not think this is art, but I'll tell you this: telling us what kind of movies we can and cannot make will guarantee that it isn't art.""And so let me say, this isn't bad as serial killer movies go and in fact better than most.[Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

750089,B00008YGRY,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,1,1,2007-08-09,They are replacing Mulder and Scully with Dogget and Reyes,"The X-Files Collection is a worthy hobby and next to Star Trek is certainly one of largest of the television series DVD collections, running an extra two seasons longer than the maximum seven season Star Trek series. Although The X-Files is not the longest running television media franchise, it can boast being one of the longest running SF series airing for nine seasons between 1993 and 2002. At around 1100 minutes per box, you are looking at approx. 9 boxes with 165 hours of viewing. That is nearly 1 full week of non-stop X-Files. Very few DVD series can come even remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and you could build up the series collection in no time. By the end you will have a television paranormal anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time over the course of a year. The X-Files creator Chris Carter nails a powerful television series premise, setting up a fringe paranormal bureau of investigation that is at odds with its own department, the government, the military and just about everyone else, with the immortal tagline ""The truth is out there"". Fox ""Spooky"" Mulder (David Duchovny) is the workaholic basement-dwelling good-looking nerd with a heart of gold and a mind for the criminal macabre, all things supernatural and who runs the X-Files department. He is teamed with Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the rational doctor turned FBI agent who is asked to write reports on the X-Files cases by her cynical boss. Most episodes play along with the theme of Mulder witnessing a paranormal event while Dana gradually arrives on the scene only after it is over, missing it all, or discovering something odd at best. This kind of regular plot occurrence bonds the characters and is what makes The X-Files so enjoyable. There are some improvements since the Season III DVD case with a seventh bonus disc now inside a cardboard holder and not just sitting in a slot in a piece of card that falls out easily like in Season I and II, bouncing around the box. Season V actually has the bonus disc in with actual holder itself. Not all boxes have this bonus seventh disc item. It depends on the edition. The more important six discs with episodes are firmly in place in a plastic flip case inside a thick season box that slides into a wider cardboard presentation holder for the shelf and looks quite good. Although the inside is slightly flimsy, these DVDs are presented on the cheap and so economically The X-Files seasons are sound value for money but the presentation is nothing to brag about and when we get around to seeing what is on the discs we will not be so blown away either. There are 4 episodes per disc, and 6 episode discs in total, making an average of 25 episodes for most seasons. Some seasons have more or less than this figure. Some discs have a few deleted scenes... and that is about it. On the episode discs there are no commentaries and not much in the way of bonus material except for some international clips with Mulder and Scully speaking in Japanese for a scene. They could have at least provided us with the X-Files remastered in 5:1 Dolby Digital but have instead just presented the series as it was aired in 2:1 surround. Again, everything here is on the cheap. The transfer quality however is very good for most of it. This season is in Widescreen 1.78:1X-Files: Season eight is the one where Mulder leaves the show (in order to pursue a career in film acting) only to appear part time. You may even be in for Mulder's death. The show begins with a brand new introductory credit sequence which actually looks very good and there are two versions, one containing Mulder leading and one without Mulder with Scully leading. This way you know if Mulder will make an appearance or not. The new agent Dogget (Robert Patrick) is set to replace Mulder as Scully's partner. The Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) is gone from the show. Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) has more of a lead role. `The Lone Gumen' John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard 'Ringo' Langly (Dean Haglund) are back as is Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea). Special Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) is also a brand new addition. FBI Deputy Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens Jr.) is really playing the bad guy this season along with the new mysterious insider Knowle Rohrer (Adam Baldwin).Season eight of the X-Files is mostly about - Agent Dogget, Gibson Praise, time travel, monster bats, religious cults, ghosts, drugs, alien pregnancy, x-ray vision, metal man, pain, Indian mystics, viruses, Mulder, alien black oil, Doggett's son, alien colonisation, mutants and Scully's child. Dogget is essentially the new sceptic so he and Scully have a lot of fun in the single episodes. Also thankfully Season eight completely omits the slapstick humour change that Season seven tried out towards the end. The cast update is actually not bad, and do stay all the way through with this season and don't just abandon it completely. This is an action-packed season with some great episodes.The major problem however is not with this season but what the producers are hiding from us. You don't see this until season nine. Essentially Special Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) is here to replace Scully. Yeah the producers are going to be moving in the direction of Special Agent Monica Reyes and Agent Dogget leading the X-Files for Season nine and possibly more. However Season nine killed the X Files. It is easy to give this series 4 to 5 stars without knowing what the producers are planning (I originally gave it 5) but when you know the truth! you can easily dock down. So Mulder essentially did leave the show in season 7 and Scully is leading for the time being but doing bit parts in season nine.",3.0,1.0,4,1,0.0,neutral,0.9931,very positive,2007,8,9

Therefore, to appease my conscience, I decided to review a Ben Affleck film I enjoy - John Frankenheimer's ""Reindeer Games"".""Reindeer Games"" is just about the most unremarkable, low-stakes thriller you could ever expect to see, featuring all the obvious twists, all the obvious turns, and set in locations and in pursuit of prizes that do not exactly get the viewer buzzing with excitement.  What makes the film work, in its own modest way, are the director and the cast.Frankenheimer is covering old territory here, but it is like watching a veteran baseball player at the plate or in the field - you've seen it a thousand times before but it is still fun to watch.  Frankenheimer knows how to edit his films just right, and he always gets a kinky, dark edge out of all his scripts.  ""Reindeer Games"" is no exception, and one of the DVD bonus features regarding differences between the film and this director's cut really lays out why Frankenheimer should be allowed to present the material as he sees fit.  The film has just enough jarring moments that, even though you've seen the typical twists and betrayals before, Frankenheimer keeps it compelling and interesting.The cast, too, rises above the pedestrian heist plot, tackling the film enthusiastically.  The movie does not ask them to do too much, so they have fun with what they have.  Ben Affleck goes into smartmouth mode, familiar territory, but puts it to amusing use as a criminal roped into doing a job he wants no part of.  One of the more amusing repeat gags involves his quest for some pecan pie, either a subtle nod or lift of Bruce Willis' cappucino quest in ""Hudson Hawk"".  Charlize Theron is alternating sweet and petulent as his would-be girlfriend.  Gary Sinise, Clarence Williams, and Danny Trejo are good, menacing fun as the heavies.  Perhaps the biggest fun is Dennis Farina hamming it up as the casino manager who brings Vegas-style class by operating a bar that offers both Coke and Pepsi.A film like ""Reindeer Games"" moves along quickly.  It has to or the inertia will allow the viewer to realize just how silly the film is.  Frankenheimer keeps the film busy enough to keep the viewer curious and engaged, while the cast does a good job of providing enough quirks and quality performances so that the film isn't forgotten two seconds after the credits start rolling.  ""Reindeer Games"" is not deep, ambitious, or original, but it is a comfortable and quality cover of heist films past.",3.0,0.8235294117647058,1,1,0.0,neutral,0.9969,very positive,2002,6,5

Like I said in my title blurb, it is a spectacular production with absolutely stunning women, particularly Abbie Cornish and Emily Browning, and it is entertaining in many ways; unfortunately, the story is only moderately interesting.Browning plays ""Baby Doll"" in the 1950s, whose wicked stepfather takes her to a mental asylum to receive a lobotomy. He wants to shut her up to hide his crimes, of course. She resorts to fantasy to escape her predicament, imagining herself and the other people at the asylum in a mob-owned brothel.

The film's not all hot babes in lingerie and CGI-laden action fantasies. But I'll have to watch it a couple of more times to figure it out. The multi-layered nature of the plot -- reality turning to fantasy and then fantasy within fantasy -- is somewhat off-putting and tends to take one out of the story.

1214739,B001LLH8SE,A2ZWTFZRNQW7D5,6,6,2012-01-30,Slow down; let us feel something,"The film begins with close-ups of red and green stoplights that evoke the human retina interspersed with unfocused and above-shots of traffic, forcing us to consider the theme of vision immediately, in the first few frames.  Likewise, the shorts of the intersection remind us of the retina.  Soon, we realize, the image has been somehow filtered, and seems to allow only shades of red and green, making the viewer effectively blind.  Soon after, as in the award-winning novel by Jose Saramago, the first mysterious case of blindness occurs.Fernando Meirelles, a brilliant director whose other films include the tremendous _City of God_, is not without a vision for this film.  By establishing a mood that alternates between the claustrophobic and agoraphobic, he attempts to capture the sense of blindness which Saramago pulls off on the page so expertly, but which is difficult to pull off on screen.  Meirelles is sensitive to the challenge that faces him, and he approaches the task admirably and smartly.  His film is an adaptation, not an appropriation, and he pays due homage to his source material.  What works in-text sometimes does not work on-screen, as any great director knows, but any attempt to improve on Saramago would seem egotistical.  Meirelles knows this, and he makes every noble attempt to faithfully adapt Saramago's work to the screen.The trouble is, everything happens so fast that we have little time to absorb it all.  Characters speak, act, and move on, and we have little time to dwell on their emotions.  When the woman suffers and dies after giving herself over to the enemy, we are provided with a sense of injustice, but are left with little sorrow.  The fast-paced technique that worked well in a film like _City of God_, which inspires an abhorrence for injustice and involves the viewer in the chaos felt by its characters, does not work in the more internally-driven _Blindness_, which requires more time to appreciate the pathos.  In the novel, we come to know the doctor's wife as a sort of philosopher-king; on-screen we see her as a frazzled woman thrown about by the influences of her environment.  It is not that the director does not have vision, and it is not that Julianne Moore does not do everything in her power to pull off the part; it is that we feel this is all happening in fast-motion.  Even the 'dog of tears', a powerful symbol in the novel, becomes just a dog in the film.  We need more time; sometimes just a few more lingering seconds could have turned a cursory moment into a poignant and memorable episode.At times, we are given the opportunity to see what a film like this could have become.  The 'raining' scene is a nice pause in the action, and it is notable that it is probably one of the most memorable scenes in the film.  Likewise, the scene late in the movie between Danny Glover and Alice Braga works well, partially because it is a minor scene that is given the attention it deserves.Some have criticized the film's ending.  In my opinion, this is the one time the director is spot-on.  With Saramago, there are no such things as clean resolutions, and Meirelles is at sensitive to this.Meirelles had his vision.  He had a great cast and superb source material.  What he really needed was another hour of screen time.  I am aware of the challenges this would have presented, but I have to be realistic about the film.  It is simply too rushed to work.  We need more time to stagger our way through the world of Blindness.",3.0,1.0,1,1,0.0,neutral,0.9933,very positive,2012,1,30

1095278,B000UJCAMC,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,2,3,2009-11-13,"2 of Stanwyck's weaker films, still worth a look for serious fans","Barbara Stanwyck is probably my favorite actress, so I'm always interested in seeing anything that I haven't from this great legend.  Certainly she brings great presence, sex appeal, and attitude to nearly every project, but I have to say that both films in this double feature - especially TO PLEASE A LADY - probably rank in the lower half of her huge output, which I'm still only beginning to explore.The only thing the films have in common really is that they mark the beginning of Stanwyck's transition from sexpot to mother/wife characters.  She was 43 in 1950 when TO PLEASE A LADY was released, and kept her figure well into old age of course, but there's an experienced air about her that's no longer in the slightest bit girlish.  Good thing too as she's paired with the near-50 Clark Gable, playing race car driver Mike Brannan, who Stanwyck as wealthy and powerful radio/newspaper columnist Regina Forbes decides to make into a human interest story at the beginning of the film.  Horrified by the way in which Brannan callously ignores a fatal crash that happens right in front of him - possibly even contributing to it - she goes out of her way to ruin him and get him out of racing, but inevitably (you knew this was coming didn't you?) falls for the roguish Gable charm.  Adolphe Menjou is along for the ride as her mean old uncle-like producer (?) Gregg.Pretty much everything in the film is telegraphed a mile away, and it's neither funny enough to provoke a chuckle nor dramatic enough to care about.  Stanwyck and Gable are both ok but don't really seem in danger of sparking any flames; this film's rather antiquated notion of sexuality involves Brannan slapping Forbes and then roughly kissing her - and her liking it.  Not a good showcase for Stanwyck as the independent woman, despite her powerful career - she was just waiting for a rough guy like Gable to take her away all along, dontcha know.  Good racing footage I suppose, if that's meaningful then I suppose it would increase your interest.  Clarence Brown directs competently enough.  Ho hum.Three years later, in the very short b-noir JEOPARDY from director John Sturges, Stanwyck has pretty well settled into the more ""mature"" (though still desirable and sexy) roles that she was to play for many more years.  She's Helen Stilwin, the mother of 10-year-old Bobby (Lee Aaker) and the wife of Doug (Barry Sullivan); the whole family is taking a trip down the then sparsely populated Baja peninsula, to places Doug visited during the war.  We get plenty of foreshadowing that they'll have problems alone in the stark countryside as we're told several times that there's almost no habitation for over 100 miles.  After a last stop at a deserted gas station where they hope to find water for the radiator, the Selwins stop at a remote pier for the night.  When Bobby gets caught and Doug has to rescue him, it's Doug who ends up pinned under a big piling as the tide is about to come in, and Helen who has to go back to the deserted station alone in search of rope to try to drag the log away and save him.This is where we get into noir territory, as Helen runs into completely amoral murderer Lawson, played by the great Ralph Meeker.  Helen is desperate to save her husband - Lawson only wants to evade the police and get away.  What will Helen have to do to keep her family safe?  Unfortunately yet again we have a film where the female character could well have been stronger - and is played by an actress who certainly would have done the job as well - but here after being playfully demeaned by her husband and then roughly mocked and condescended to by the brutal Lawson she never really gets to show her stuff.  Not that one expects feminism in noir, exactly, or in any film from this period, but it surprises me to see Stanwyck in a role like this where her only choice is to use her feminine wiles - and even those don't seem to be enough to get the job done as she has to resort to pleading and crying.Still, despite my ambivalence about the Helen character, I think the film is a pretty decent one, with not a moment wasted (in less than 70 minutes), a terrifically gleeful malevolent presence in Meeker, and a really terrific ending that does serve to redeem both the amorality of Lawson and the helplessness of Helen.  Fine location work and photography by Victor Milner help matters also.So JEOPARDY is a thumbs-up, if not a really enthusiastic one, and TO PLEASE A LADY a mild thumbs-down.  All in all, worth it if you're a Stanwyck fan or a hard-core noir enthusiast; otherwise, probably not.",3.0,0.6666666666666666,4,1,-0.3182,negative,0.9975,very positive,2009,11,13

This film is entertaining enough, after a style, but the script is as clumsy as the stage is cluttered, as one great character actor after another bump into one another as the plot zips unsuspensefully by.  A murder is committed, but the police peg it as a suicide until Vance pops up to prove them wrong, playfully locking horns with the inept Sargeant in charge of the case (delightfully portrayed by the gravel-voiced Eugene Palette).  Not one of director Michael Curtiz's brightest moments -- things just whiz by too quickly and the formula isn't given enough time to develop a sense of charm or wit.

94762,0790731002,A3V43IU15LA3HA,1,1,2012-10-21,Not a Bad Film; Could Have Been Much Better,"If you are at all interested, I would get the 2-disc special edition of Batman Forever. Like the similar sets for each of the other Burton/Schumacher Batman films, it packs a terrific array of special features. The most thought provoking part of those features, for me, is the documentary segment that discusses how some of the deleted scenes were cut in order to keep the film from being too dark. (Understandable in the wake of Batman Returns.) The thing is that these scenes were the emotional heart of the screenplay, giving psychological insight into Bruce Wayne in a way that tied many of the other parts of the film together. A true pity that the theatrical cut neglected some of the deepest moments of storytelling.Anyway, in general, I think that Batman Forever is much, much better than its sequel, Batman & Robin. The main difference is that this one has a very good story, and for the most part sticks to telling it. In my opinion, Val Kilmer is a terrific Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Chris O'Donnell's portrayal of Robin is perfect; in fact, the Robin backstory is incredibly good, arguably the best part of the film. Nichole Kidman is great playing a psychologist, and if her character is a bit underdeveloped, Dr. Chase Meridian fits perfectly into the storyline. My personal biggest gripe with Batman Forever is that the villains are portrayed way over the top. In the case of Jim Carrey as the Riddler, that can nearly be forgiven, as he is ridiculously entertaining. However, Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face was just too much, a waste of a great character. (The role played by Aaron Eckhart in The Dark Knight was so much better.)Some people did not like the aesthetic design of Batman Forever. It is a visual spectacle, often overloading the senses, and I agree that nipples on the costumes was unecessary. However, I think that many of the stylistic touches, including the more futuristic Batmobile, the gang of punks with lightsticks and day-glo grafitti, and the use of some techno music in the soundtrack, were actually good, timely touches. If this film had stuck to those guns a bit more, it could have almost verged into a genuinely edgy cyberpunk territory.Ultimately, this is not a bad film. I wish that it had been more serious, but it does have its moments. It was a huge success upon its release, and although it has suffered quite a bit by being associated with Joel Schumacher's next outing, Batman & Robin, it is still worth giving a chance, especially if you are a longtime Batman fan and, like me, you remember how incredibly cool this was back in 1995.",3.0,1.0,1,1,0.6956,very positive,0.9883,very positive,2012,10,21

Night Shyamalan was on board here as a producer and also came up with this I believe so I was interested to say the least. I heard many things about this movie, some good some bad so I had to check it out. After watching this I have to say I liked more than I thought but it wasn't what I expected. I was actually expecting something a little more, scary I guess. But still for a pg 13 film it was good.A man has committed suicide by way of jumping out of a window of a building; of course the police are called in. while there it seems there is a problem in the same building, an elevator is stuck with a group of people stuck on it. The thing is something wrong is going on, like people getting killed inside the elevator. As the police and security look on from a security camera they try to figure it out and stop what it going on. The thing is an evil presence may be inside that building and it just may be the devil, here to punish the wicked.The idea behind this film is great and really had me hyped about this movie; I always seem to like these types of flicks. I must say that the atmosphere here is nice but this movie reminds me of the Twilight Zone, Tales from the Darkside, Tales from the Crypt and stuff like that. With that said it feels as short as one of those episodes, really it feels really short. The acting at least is good especially those in the elevator, pretty much every one here does a good job.This film is far from the best ever and that is a little disappointing, it had the potential to be a classic.

It is a message that Director Rob Cohen is getting out....Cold war James Bond agents cannot handle the baddies of the 21st century.Xander Cage is an extreme stunt reckloose who has a criminal record and freely breaks the law in his own personal cause. This gets the attention of the NSA and CIA who is having problems with a group called Anarchy99.Cage is recruited by Gibbons (played by Sam Jackson) and is ""encouraged"" to do good for the USA, even though he is the typical anti-hero (actually a ripoff of Snake Plisken from Escape from New York). He infiltrates Anarchy99 and befriends the leader Yorgi and is immediately drawn to Yelena (Asia Argento). He discovers their plot to gas the beautiful city of Prague and sets off to stop them.Xander is played by Vin Diesel, an actor that plopped on the radar screen when he produced and directed his own films years ago. That caught the attention of Steven Spielberg who cast him in ""Saving Private Ryan"". That led to more roles, in movies like Pitch Black and Boiler Room, but he really got noticed with ""Fast and the Furious"". Vin does have a charismatic aura around him, unless he talks. Luckily Xander is a man of action, not one to quote Shakespeare for 10 minutes.The movie itself is a ripoff of the proto-typical James Bond movie. XXX has his own M, his own Q, his own gadget car, he fights a bond-like Eurotrash badguy who needs to elaborately setup a weapon of mass destruction that could be done with a simple set of suitcase bombs. And of course, Bond always gets the girl and the ending is very bondish as well. However, it feels more like a ripoff than an homage.Some of the stunts had people laughing and my eyes rolling. The stunts with the motorcycles were laugh out loud funny, but some were excellent, such as Xander bridge jumping with the Vette and him riding out the avalanche of his own causing.Asia Argento, daughter of famed Director Dario Argento also smolders, even with the piercing stares.

Even more as with the previous releases in this series (""Swan Lake"" and ""Giselle"", both published by TDK) the main reason for acquiring this DVD will be the presence of the two stars.Filmed live at La Scala in May 2006, the company can be seen in Natalia Makarova's well-known staging of Marius Petipa's ""La Bayad&egrave;re"", among others danced by London's Royal Ballet (and also available on a TDK DVD, starring Altynai Asylmuratova, Irek Mukhamedov and Darcey Bussell). As in the Royal Ballet's version the traditional sets are by Pier Luigi Samaritani, the costumes by Yolanda Sonnabend.The company of La Scala proves competent, if nothing more. The female corps de ballet does a commendable job in the Shades Act, but the absence of noteworthy demi-soloists constitutes a serious handicap, as does the generally fast conducting of David Coleman. Moreover, by casting corps member Isabelle Brusson in the crucial role of Gamzatti, the dramatic development is seriously unbalanced. Understudy Brusson obviously wasn't ready yet for so challenging an assignment.Bolshoi Ballet guest star Svetlana Zakharova, in one of her signature roles, easily dominates the performance, dramatically as well as by the quality of her dancing. As a supreme adagio ballerina, her appearance in the Kingdom of the Shades act, serene and cool, reveals the choreography in all its glory. La Scala's own Roberto Bolle is her likeable if never too exciting Solor.Directed by Tina Protasoni for video and TV the fast multi-camera editing and unnecessary close-ups of faces during or at the ending of a movement are ultimately annoying. Otherwise, image and sound quality are top-notch.In short, all admirers of Svetlana Zakharova and/or Roberto Bolle will rush to purchase this DVD, others will look for their Bayad&egrave;re elsewhere.",3.0,0.9615384615384616,1,1,-0.4404,negative,0.9731,very positive,2007,3,9

1224354,B001OQCV6A,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,4,5,2010-03-30,Elementary!,"SHERLOCK HOLMES was a bit much for my tired old eyes--but the character studies on offer here are excellent. Absolutely spot-on. Sherlock Holmes was an ardent thrill-seeking drug addict who did indeed prize-fight under a pseudonym; he was a master of several fighting arts. The art of which Holmes is a renowned master, ""Bartitsu"" was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's and does not exist. Ugly Victorian boxing is real, and Holmes could whip any man in that arena also.This film presents us with a Dr. Watson I always imagined: virile, young, butt-kicking and brave enough to stand next to Holmes...and stand up to him. Although a good doctor, Watson was a career soldier and extremely well trained. Holmes wouldn't work with just anyone. Jude Law is up to snuff and in fact rather underused, but then in the original stories, Watson did feel underused a great deal.Like Law, Robert Downey does a spectacular job interpreting from Doyle directly: he swaggers, sneers at society and nastily growls at his housekeeper Mrs. Hudson, calling her ""nanny"". He is a bored drug addict, but he is also a crime-fighter and very dedicated. He wants his photos where he can see them, not in the newspapers. He's a fellow young people today can and should understand. This movie serves that aim very well.I think Doyle would have loved these portrayals, and the visual texture would have evoked memories for Doyle too. For the Holmes fan, there are tributes galore to the past: the sweeping street scene at the beginning evokes the Granada Television SHERLOCK HOLMES of the late Jeremy Brett, as if paying a goodbye-homage. The appearance of Irene Adler would confuse all but the most well-read fan. The silly experiments and antisocial behavior of Holmes also confuses, unless one is well-read in the original stories.The plotline, in my opinion, is contrived, but it is secondary to what is being done here, on a more sublime level. The director is trying to reintroduce a younger audience to Sherlock Holmes, and this is the first time since Brett's performance that a young audience can get the feel of the real deal. So I took away a star for the weak, frankly stupid storyline. I do feel guilty about that star I took away: Holmes' analysis-before-a-fight routine is so familiar (to me) and I was delighted with the skill employed to make it work.Yet as I said, this film does so much with the characters it cannot be missed. Anyone without the time to read the original stories can get a solid feel for what Doyle originally imagined, and for the real world in which he lived and practiced medicine. If I were to choose one other weakness aside from plot, it is that Holmes is not as restrained and logical as he was intended to be. I suppose that is my personal beef with Downey, who is generally not one of my favorites.Finally, I do have one solitary gripe I must express: where is Mycroft, Sherlock's older and much smarter brother?",3.0,0.8,3,7,0.0,neutral,0.9711,very positive,2010,3,30

1252704,B00275EGWY,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,2,5,2010-03-14,OSCAR WORTHY?,"I've grown accustomed to being disappointed in the wins for best picture at the Oscars over the last few years. It seems those who make the decisions are so dead set on being taken seriously as artists that they fail to choose films that are popular as well as artistic, going for the dramatic punch that they feel shows how serious they are. When you discount one aspect of a film in an attempt to look at another, you lose perspective of the whole meaning of the award. I always looked at the Oscar as rewarding the best and the brightest. It seems that stopped a few years back and continues to do so this year with THE HURT LOCKER.Don't get me wrong. The movie is a good look at the world our military goes through on a day to day basis in war torn countries, this one being Iraq. But with all the movies I saw this past year, this was not the one that I though came near being the best. And Kathryn Bigelow has long deserved notice in Hollywood. Her work in the past was ignored and the making of this film wasn't done by a major Hollywood studio. That shows how much they truly respect her. The nicest thing about it is that she will now have enough clout to get more of her movies off the ground.So the story. The film opens with a group of soldiers in an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit. Their job is to dismantle, disarm or explode any bombs that are found in the area they are stationed in. The weapons of choice they most often come into contact with are Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) and they have one here. As they attempt to prevent the bomb from exploding, an insurgent with a cell phone explodes it, killing the group's leader.The film moves on to the new leader of the group, the new bomb expert Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner). Sergeant Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), one of the remaining soldiers, welcomes James to Camp Victory which was Camp Liberty but they decided this sounded better. In his quarters, James has taken off the boards covering the windows to let light in. When Sanborn points out they were installed to keep mortar fire from coming through, James points out that the mortars could easily come in through the roof and he prefers the light. As the film progresses, this becomes a telling moment into the psychological state of mind of James.With only 38 days left of service, the team is sent out to do their job in the city. Completing the group is Specialist Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), also witness to the first death. As they arrive at locations throughout the film to disarm bombs, the cautious Sanborn and Eldridge are perplexed by James willingness to confront danger head on. His unwillingness to follow protocol or to listen to Sanborn leads to a confrontation as well as several hair raising sequences where they set out to save lives by taking the bombs out.The differences in these men are what make up the meat of the film. Sanborn wants to follow orders and wants to survive, yet he doesn't see that in James. Eldridge is the most apparently mentally disturbed of the trio, talking with the camp psychiatrist as he deals with the death that surrounds him. But it is James that is the most frightening of the group, living without fear of death, taking apart bombs as if there's nothing more thrilling to do, trying to find solutions to each one he comes across.James character is so in tune with his love of danger that he keeps a box of bomb parts and detonators under his bed. It is James' story that is the focus of the film. He has become so involved in his position that he seeks out danger, that adrenaline rush that comes with it. The problem is that at the same time he puts his men in harm's way as well.While the trio evolve into a sense of camaraderie, they also begin to come apart in thanks to James' need for the rush. With days counting down as the story moves forward, the tensions mount.Sound like a good movie? Well, it sort of is. But at the same time the tenseness of the situations these men find themselves in is played out in a semi-real time mode. The viewer is required to sit and painstakingly wait as the clock ticks by while bombs are taken out.While each actor and character are played well, the main focus on James by Renner is exceptional. A young actor just getting notice, Renner portrays a complex series of emotions in James, from the thrill junkie to the tender hearted man who weeps at the sight of a young boy he got to know who appears to be murdered with a bomb planted inside of him later on.The film confronts some tough issues concerning war and the world we face in Iraq. But the best thing that it does is not take a major stand on the issues. It doesn't go right or left politically but tells the tale of the men in uniform straight on.So why didn't I think it deserved the Oscar for best picture? Because it was long and drawn out, it moved at a snails pace and it didn't entertain me. Yes, it was well made (with the exception of the hand held jostling camera that seems to have become a favorite lately) and yes it told a compelling story. But I never felt involved, never invested in the characters enough to get into the film.I know, many people will take exception with my views as to this not being deserving of the award. But when did we decide that gritty, hard tempered films were the only ones deserving? When did films that contained hope become the black sheep? When did movies that made us laugh or sing suddenly become unworthy?I am a firm believer that most people go to movies to escape the world they live in, to get away from the moments of pain, poverty, anger and down right meanness they are exposed to daily. Those are the movies that inspire and give hope. They deserve to be rewarded. And yet Hollywood continues to choose message films instead. It is because of this that I can't say this movie deserves the award.As for a viewing, I'm not even sure I can recommend it for that either. It is tedious at worst and contains fine performances at best. The only way to choose viewing this is making the choice on your own, knowing inside what it is you expect from a film, what you want from one. I know I couldn't sit through this one again, not due to the content but due to the slowness of it.",3.0,0.4,5,3,0.4404,positive,0.9951,very positive,2010,3,14

This came from the original movie, the French-madeTHE APARTMENT(L'APPARTEMENT) of which this is practically a scene-for-scene remake. Both movies actually begin near the end of the plot, relying on extensive flashbacks. They are really a jumble of out-of-order scenes that are presumably tied up in the end in a sensible way. In WICKER PARK, I didn't find it tied up very neatly, albeit, the conclusion was understandable enuf. (I saw L'APPARTEMENT later and I can't say that it would have been different for me if I saw that first even tho it has a VERY different ending.)Upon re-watching the film with and eye to figuring out the timeline, I began to see how much better the film would have been in a conventional form. This had the potential to be a  satisfying movie.As for the cast, top marks go to the very lovely young Aussi, Rose Byrnes, so convincing and heart-rending as the mousey girl, and Matthew Lillard as a lively friend.

The humor is very good (revenge on a nasty boss, Colin Farrell's reaction to the ""brown sauce,"" etc.), the acting is very good (Farrell, Colm Meany, Cillian Murphy, and the ex-girlfriend), and even the pacing and creativity is very good.  If this movie had ended with the same confidence and orginality that it began with, we'd have an excellent film.  However, the finale is so cliche and unbelievable that I can't even bring myself to recommend the film.  Two major plotlines, one with Colin Farrell, a cop, and a documentary film maker, and another with Cillian Murphy and his ex-girlfriend, end so horribly cliche that my friend and I turned the film off in disgust, laughing at the idiocy and swearing at the near-destruction of an excellent film.  Let's put it this way...the movie sets itself up to be a realistic yet unpredictable tale of life in Dublin, and following that logic, certain people in the movie should die, certain people should live, and certain people should want nothing to do with others.  The movie washes it all away with a surpringly cliche Hollywood ending that ties strings together that never deserved to be tied.  There were parts in the conclusion that the audience members were clearly intended to rejoice over, but they were so trite that even the actors couldn't completely pull it off.  Rent this movie for the first three quarters, but prepare to be dissapointed at the end if you're an intelligent film goer.

Here, despite the illogical design of the plot, the actors performed at least decently. (Warning: plot spoiler in the next sentence) However, after Charlize Theron's character was killed, then the movie was somewhat balanced on the shoulders of less riveting actors, which even dragged her performance down, when looking back upon this film. Regardless, it was far from her awkwardly overacted Snow White performance. Most of the actors/actresses at least performed on a level well above the gutter-level, where the franchise lost course after A3.Plot:Other reviewers have gone to lengths to explain all the ways the character's decisions made no sense, and it is true that this is typically the key aspect of most plots, however in the case of comic book and science fiction type movie, plot also serves on a macro level to tie-in other chapters, background stories, and to explain or justify supernatural forces which defy common science. So, on a mirco level like a play, this is far from Shakespeare, and the motivations and justifications for each character's actions are wildly skewed, but for me this was merely a vehicle to deliver the actions of placing this group of screw-ups in the right place at the right time to cause the critical error that gave birth to countless nightmares later in the chronology. Of course, the more extreme nerds will not be able to resist the kind of over-analysis that can shred any appreciation of a film like this. But, if no one was stupid in a sci-fi/horror film, then no one would die or make the critical errors that led to this otherwise mostly non-regrettable franchise.Appearance:Clearly the film's strong suit is it's often mind-numbing CGI and the way it blends so seamlessly in most scenes. The only part where the illusion may have been broken a bit was when the robotic guy's head was laying there talking and it just felt like an invisible body, and not the visceral milk-blood robot head that it strove to reference and be similar to, from Alien 3. The rolling ship was a very cool scene, even if it was a little bit of a forced Indiana Jones thing. The hologram parts were very cool, and overall it was money well spent on both the graphics and the special effects make-up. I cannot say as much for the bottled set design or forced toy marketing of Resurrection or Alien Vs Predator 1-2.Overall:The film did it's job of rebooting the franchise, under proper direction. with a fairly ample cast and some flashy technology. Of course the actions and motivations of the characters can tend to be a bit flimsy in a way that does not render cliches into tropes, because it does not really shout-out the sort of films where an idiot going into a dark place is charmingly classic. However, the script was actually written nicely, which is a key element seldom mentioned, and also sorely lacking from the blunder of Resurrection. With enjoyable special effects, a decent script, and mostly ample performances, I don't see a reason why this film is not a suitable addition to the franchise. It is a situation where I am afraid our memory of the early films is greater than the films themselves. The first film was almost entirely shot in the dark and barely showed the alien at all. The second film had a big part played by Paul Riser (the man should have a tattoo that says ""campy""), and the series really only reached fever pitch in the third film, which raised the bar on the franchise only long enough for it to be plunged into the abyss of the next 3 films. So, what hardcore nerds want out of this film is impossible to deliver (much like Star Wars, Evil Dead, Star Trek, etc).

The battle showed sweat and blood, a non-theatrical production in comparison to this 1944, very theatrical, Olivier production.  Some reviewers denounce the heavy-handed acting of 1944, but I find it charming.Olivier has an economical charisma.  His acting has few flourishes, but his voice says everything. Olivier in period costume is mesmerizing.  As Shakespeare's bad-boy prince turned earnest King, Olivier takes charge and demands the return of English lands from the rather effeminate French nobility.  Outnumbered 10 to one, his merry band of Englishmen dispatches the Dolphin at Agincourt.  Then he courts the French speaking princess Katherine with broken French and elegant economy.The recreation of old London and the Globe Theatre was delightful.  The audience and players went on in heavy rains without complaint.  The mention of Falstaff's name is enough to get applause, though the buffoon has only a short death scene.I do believe the play has been abridged.  Many of the longer speeches seem shortened.  Still, this is accessible Shakespeare.  How can you go wrong?  Never!",3.0,0.9333333333333332,3,1,0.4767,positive,0.9157,very positive,2005,2,8

But I particularly like this & Far & Away as well, as Tom & Nicole made such a good on-screen couple, as well as off screen.OK, the film does get a bit boring, and I did find myself doing other things during the car race scenes, as I've seen the film that many times before, I didn't need to watch them again.

John Hurt is too good an actor to be bad, and represents an English FBI agent (whose wife's brutal murder opens the movie) bent on torture well. His penchant for being cast as a talking-head-on-a-screen, like he did recently in V for Vendetta also works here. Perhaps it is his ability for seething unabashed cruelty. Burt Lancaster is fine as well, neither here nor there as the shadowy figure of power.The film does have well paced and suspenseful action sequences, standard Peckinpah slow-motion violence, and an ultimately oppressive use of technology as communicator and omniscient weapon of mass destruction.Not bad, a decent rental, certainly a dated technological piece, with illuminative hair and style for an actioner....",3.0,0.6,3,1,0.4926,positive,-0.9528,very negative,2006,5,20

The very elements that are the most distracting and disturbing are ultimately the things that make it interesting. Plus, it never hurts to have Michael Caine in the movie.Not necessarily a fan of Nicholas Cage's work, I could not help but give him grudging admiration for his work in this film. For all his past excesses and over-the-top histrionics, Cage has gradually toned it down in the last decade and has discovered that ""less is more.""This has never been more true than in his portrayal of weather man David Spritz. Cage somehow ""sad sacks"" his way into the heart of the viewer, despite the fact that his character is unburdened by many redeemable qualities. (Let's face it, no one expects a weather man to be Albert Schweitzer.) While it is difficult to empathize with the whining of a guy who receives a huge salary - and a few other perks - for no other discernable skills other than being able to read a teleprompter, Cage somehow manages to play this guy as an ""everyman.""(I never believed Cage as a TV personality - he didn't have the hair for the local weather gig - though given the bald pates of both Al Roker and Willard Scott, I guess the ""anchor hair"" is not necessarily a requirement for a network job.)It is however Michael Caine who comes packing ""gravitas"" in this movie He imbues this film with a depth that would otherwise be lacking. Playing against type, his portrayal of a reserved, emotionally unavailable father is a masterwork. I was riveted every time his character came on the screen. Although one could see how his emotionally utilitarian demeanor might have affected his son, he somehow remains sympathetic, which I credit to Caine's skills as an actor. Casting Caine in this film was a coup for the director, as he brings the good will of the audience to any role he tackles.Hope Davis has never been more attractive, even while her character plays a little shrill. Gemmene De La Pena offers a respite from the cookie cutter moppets that usually pop up in Hollywood movies. (Hopefully the storyline of her subplot doesn't dog her the rest of her life.) Nicholas Hoult gives an adult performance in another role that breaks the mold for acceptable storylines for kids in movies. Gil Bellows is appropriately slimy from the get go, signaling ahead where that story strand is headed.Although the humor is crass and sophomoric, by the end of the film I found myself moved by the foibles of the all-too-human characters. The script is all over the place with several little stories competing for our attention, but perhaps that is the way life is. (Don't ask me about the bow and arrow bit - I am still not sure about that.) Screenwriter Steve Conrad has lavished so much love into the layering of the story and the crafting of the film's characters that I was sure that it had to be an adaptation of a favorite novel.""The Weather Man"" is a movie that kept me interested despite its many shortcomings.

The second outing Director Don Sharp's 'THE BRIDES OF FU MANCHU'- 1966 was released by MGM in its Midnight Madness series a few years back so this marks the only one left in the series to be released. Having formed a team with Producer Harry Allan Towers who would produce the entire Fu Manchu series and other films under the direction of Jess Franco, Lee would just be utilized for his name drawing power as he steadily would be given declining scripts and cheap production values making the role a parody of what it once was.  Here we have actor Douglas Wilmer in his second outing as Sir Nayland Smith and brilliant German actor Horst Frank who graced many Spaghetti Westerns and Euro-thrillers as Rudy in a deliciously evil performance.  Towers includes his wife actress Maria Rohm who appeared in all of his productions and is just required to bring eye candy to the proceedings with her beauty.  There is also a blink or you'll miss cameo by actor Peter Carsten who played villainous roles throughout the sixties including a standout performance in Director Jack Cardiff's 'DARK OF THE SUN'- 1968.  The story involves making a doppelganger of Nayland Smith which starts getting long in the tooth before its 91 minute running time is over with and the production benefits from awesome authentic locations which would be few and far between in Fu's last two outings.  Not a bad way to spend a nostalgic Saturday afternoon, it gives the opportunity for fans to see the underrated acting ability of actress Tsai Chin as Fu's loyal daughter.

When he asked the translator about it, the translator admitted that he didn't translate the joke but said ""Mr. Carter is telling a joke. Mr. Carter is done telling the joke. Please laugh."" to the audience.That's the feeling I get out of the music from this movie. I don't usually notice incidental music. You're not supposed to notice incidental music. It's supposed to support the action and keep things movie. In this movie it was doing all the heavy lifting. Even before she gets to the house (lovely house by the way - anyone that watches Merchant Ivory solely for the architecture should check out this movie) the music is blaring away. Example:""You shouldn't call before 8pm"" (DUH DUH DUH DHU DHU DHU!!!!)""I know Daddy but why should I have to be punished"" (CREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECH!)""You know the rules. No car for a month."" (DUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUUDUDUDU!!!!!!!!)Somewhere there's a cello player whose put his kids through college on trilling the same note in movies like this. Since the director decided to drag out the first half of the original movie to the whole movie, he's got very little too work with in the first hour before the stranger calls. Instead the protagonist walks through the house, looks at the jewelry, turns on the automatic lights, turns off the automatic lights, admires the furniture, turns on the automatic fireplace accidently, plays the stereo too loud -- well you get the point.Did I mention that it's a very pretty house?By the time the evil killer calls, you're so bored out of your skull that you want him to stop wasting his time on the phone and just waste the chick. Then he can sit around the house, eating chitos and running his hand over the pretty furniture. It's very pretty furniture.Instead he has to play out the stalker game. He doesn't even say ""Have you checked the children?"" until the 14th phone call (ok I didn't count but I should have) and when he does she goes and CHECKS THE CHILDREN??!!? Yeah that's real exciting. At least that way we know that there really are children in the house. Most of the time he's not speaking. It's probably not a psyche game. He's probably just waiting for the music to stop playing so he can get a word in edgewise.Not only is this movie dull, it's disappointing.

You can tell the story of this movie on the way home and you'll be checking the closets and turning on all the ligths and securing the windows.

The best thing that can be said about this film is that the camera angles were interesting. Other than that, this boring chatfest features a must-be-seen performance by Dick Chamberlain where he channels Bette Davis, Truman Capote, and Winston Churchill -- simultaneously.So, a dying gay lawyer wants to leave his fortune to two hustlers he spent time with. Okay -- an intriguing premise. But unfortunately, there is not one single believable relationship or character in the entire film.I kept watching this film in amazement. The ""lead"" hustler kept saying either to others or to himself, ""What do you mean? Why did you say that? Why the f**k am I here? What the f**k does that mean?"" and questions of that nature. And as he asked them, so did I: What was the meaning of this whole insane waste of time?Then there were fun scenes with the ""big stars"" -- Talia Shire ""plays"" the ""part"" of ""mother"" of the second hustler. She has two pointless, irritating scenes, one where the only thing taking up the frame is her head and her hustler son's head as she rambles and goes on about something that had no meaning. Then later we get to see her sleeping in a chair. Good job, Talia! Another Oscar nomination for you!But the worst offender of all is Dick Chamberlain. Dick says certain lines as if he has imbued them with some magical wit or humor or sarcasm, as if he has elevated them to some Shakespearean level. As if what he is forced to say has some meaning. Hate to break it to you Dick: it doesn't -- none of it does, did or will.This movie almost defies description. If you want to study what not to do when making a movie, this would be an excellent reference.This movie satisfied my curiousity about the lives of hustlers: sad, tragic, dangerous, filled with unhappiness and loneliness.",1.0,0.5,1,1,0.0,neutral,-0.9936,very negative,2006,5,13

I asked him afterwards if he would like eventually to own a tape of the movie for our &quot;Titanic&quot; collection. &quot;Are you kidding?&quot; he said, &quot;This movie isn't about the 'Titanic'.&quot;  And so it isn't. It's about a couple of 90's kids (and I mean 1990's, not 1890's) in a cinematic playground that reminds us vaguely of the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster. (That anybody should complain of the predictability of the ending is a sure sign that this film has suckered us into a wrong purpose for our tale.

In all likelihood, the worst Christmas-themed film of all time (and one of the worst films of any genre of all time) is the 1964 flop ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"".  Picture (if you dare) the unhappy and non-playful children of Mars, with one of them, named Girmar, played by the not-particularly-talented actress Pia Zadora.  Her brother, Bomar, was played by Chris Month, whose only other acting role was an appearance in a single episode of a long-forgotten 1964 TV show.  Their father, Kimar (Leonard Hicks, 1918-1971, whose only other acting role in the 1964 film ""Guns of the Trees"" is uncredited), decides, after consulting with an 800-year old Martian in a cave, that the best way to help the sad and non-playful children of Mars is to kidnap Santa Claus (John Call, 1915-1973) from Earth's North Pole and bring him to Mars so that he can make toys for Martian children.  Kidnapped along with Santa Claus are two annoying Earthling children: Billy (Victor Stiles) and Betty (Donna Conforti).  Can you think of any two names more precious than Billy & Betty? (Gag!)  One Martian, Voldar (Vincent Beck, 1924-1984, one of the few 'stars' of this flop that actually had an acting career), is opposed to Santa Claus; but Kimar overrules him.  However, the completely annoying (am I being redundant?) Martian named Dropo (Bill McCutcheon, 1924-2002, who played Owen Jenkins in the wonderful 1989 ""Steel Magnolias"" and also had a real acting career) becomes Santa Claus' best Martian assistant.Now, if this flop of a film's plot hasn't been bad enough, just wait: it gets worse! You also get to hear the delightful (correction: insidious!) song ""Hooray for Santa Claus"" (written by Roy Alfred & Milton Delugg), not just once, but twice during this film's miserable 81 minutes.  Further, to give you an idea of just how 'well-written' this film's script is, my favorite quote comes from the TV interviewer (Don Blair) when he says, ""Wow-wee-wow!""  Of course, what can you expect from a film whose estimated budget was $200,000?  Who, then, you may ask, was the 'creative genius' behind ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians""?  It was none-other-than Paul L. Jacobson, who both produced it and wrote its ridiculous story.  Not surprisingly, Paul L. Jacobson was never involved in any other film or TV show at all!  In other words, ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" is his legacy to mankind.  Rather than name those other 'actors' who also appeared in this film, I will spare them the obvious embarrassment that they would probably prefer to forget.With absolutely no hesitation whatsoever, I wholeheartedly rate ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" with a well-deserved & lowest-ranking 1 out of 5 stars.

It was campy, perfectly synchronized with the oddities of 1960s design, worldview, and style, and told good, short stories.  It was a wonderful world unto itself.By contrast, this film tries for camp without synching with the times, for an old-fashioned chemistry that it traduces (Emma and Steed had wonderful sexual tension, but everything else was implied, never shown), and for a weird yet believable story.  But it fails utterly.This film is so bad that it is like making a comic book version of a comic book.

Fortunately, man has still some sense of individualism, but barely, and Kraftwerk's fascist goal for music has not rendered vocals obsolete. Listening to this, it harkens back to the techno geek 1970's when Germans laden in neo-fascist uniforms with thin ties and a pound of grease on their hair, showed no emotion on stage, acting like machines. Most of them wore leather pants so tight that they froze while playing, hence the dumb and inarticulate Krautbot look. They copied architecture chic from the 1930's, added some 70's porn montage and called it ""modern"" 1970's and praised the revolution of robots and computers. Not only is that very idea horrifying, but it is also silly. ""Kraftwerk"" means ""cheese plant"" in German and they are very cheesy.The DVD is probably one of the most horrible things I've listened to. If you can get to the end of it, you'll find all sorts of unwanted electronic noise, Krautbot voice dubs, electro fuzz, beeps, computer konks, repugnant computer-generated vocals, static, repulsive synthesizers, and extremely unpleasant clamor that goes on forever, that you'll soon be reaching for a hammer to crush the CD. In my estimation, all crap. A few American bands at the time tried the stale trend with deadly results, Gary Numan The Pleasure Principle (1979), Styx Kilroy Was Here (1983) , both tossed their careers away because of it.You'll be reminded of foolish telephone companies, lumbering computer screens, electronic wires, gay 70's discos, and moronic techno cabarets in smelly, dark German cellars. So, unless you're a nerd or have little taste in music, forget this stuff ever existed.Here's the deal... some of these Kraftwerk movies are so horrible that no sane human being would sit and force themselves to go through the agony of actually watching them. On the other hand, there are 3 hours of them. And there are some novelties here like Kraftwerk early music (which I can assure you really is in bad taste-- but completely unenjoyable). This particular collection is mostly 80's crap that just never hit for very palpable reasons.It's the Criterion Collection's ugly misshapen sister-- all the Kraftwerk movies that no discerning cinephile would ever watch.

So prof becomes a defender of her nerdy student who is in jail for reasons so flimsy that you would think this was being filmed in Syria. The prof, everyone calls Professor, and the cop, everyone calls Detective - how formal - are as stereotyped as any that Hollywood has ever produced. Prof acts like she's never even been in a classroom in any capacity student, custodian, whatever. Cop acts like he's never even seen a police officer or been in a police station in any capacity.Wouldn't be a movie unless there's some twist which is that the prof spends the entire movie trying to prove the innocence of her nerdy student when she's just a devil of a person in disguise. By the way, how did she make it into college? She and her accomplice surfer dude boyfriend (goof: he's surfing in 2 foot waves that only break 15 feet from shore - what an animal!) both get snagged at the end. And, just as predictably, the prof's brother is sent free.Acting was read the lines tolerable from mostly TV-series and B movie actors - well, it pays the bills. Directing was really rough as the cuts and scene jumps made the movie not very suspenseful. Mustang chase scene with screeching tires and curvy roads was distractingly pointless and when our prof brakes from 60mph on a short dirt pull off without skidding out of control was just not believable.",1.0,0.4285714285714285,6,1,0.0,neutral,-0.5556,negative,2012,1,29

After a fairly funny start -- a spoof of a theatrical lead in about what you shouldn't be doing in the theater -- it quickly dives to the bottom. Its cultural references are mediocre; its attempts at gross-out humor boring. Sometimes, people who are stoned off their gourds can be funny. Other times, they can only put together things that appear funny to them ... and no one else. This falls squarely into the latter category. (No question the people who made this were on drugs.

But the third one was bad, because it veered away from the actual story. That being, following up in some fashion, with the events that occurred in Halloween 2.This particular film, which is the sixth in the series, is bad, because it strives to offer an explanation for the actions of Haddonfield  maniac, Michael Myers.  The problem is, the explanation is convoluted and full of historic nonsense, that would require the average Halloween fan, to keep an encyclopedia or smart phone handy, just to understand the supposed reasons Michael Myers has done all that he has done.This film has a confusing beginning, that is fraught with inconsistencies, to an even muddled middle, to a pathetically stupid ending. If the people behind this film, had created a nationwide contest, asking Halloween fans to come up with a plot for this movie, they would've received more interesting ideas from the public, than what they eventually went with.The one star I have given this DVD, is for effort. I as a fan, have always wanted to know the WHY of what made Michael Myers tick. Donald Pleasance had always done such an outstanding job as Dr. Sam Loomis. This poor man tried to help a child that had murdered his sister. He did not speak, thus, Dr. Loomis could never really get a 'why' out of him. All Dr. Loomis is left with is this foreboding sense that there is no reaching his patient. That he is dangerous and that he should never be let out into society again.We have a killer, who we see as a child, commit an act of murder against his older sister on a Halloween night in 1963. But he does not murder his parents. Michael waits until his baby sister, (whom we did not know WAS his sister until the second film) gets to be about the same age as his dead sister, escapes the institution he has been locked in for years and returns to town to kill her.I had hoped that maybe, Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers, would have explained the central plot of this series, meaning WHY Michael seemed so focused on killing off family members. But what this film did was add to the confusion. An ancient cult plot is introduced, only to be revealed as some kind of hoax near the end, and replaced with a half baked cloning mini-plot.Why did a six year old boy murder his teenage older sister?

I really did. After reading so many great reviews in so many publications I was looking forward to a non-Hollywood uplifting tale. What I got was a slow and dull borefest.First of all, I cannot fathom how Keisha Castle-Hughes is nominated for an academy award. Her performance is minimal. Perhaps this is supposed to be her character but I have not seen a more monosyllabic display since Sylvester Stallone took on the role of John Rambo in First Blood. All she does is stand around, looking detached and sullen. Anybody can do that. I do admit that she did a good job crying during the scene with her speech. But big Arnie cried in End of Days and I don't see anyone handing him and Oscar.In regards to the rest of the cast, there is NO character development. There are some hints but nothing is ever explained. Like why does Pai love her grandfather so much when he is horrid towards her? What's the deal with her uncle smoking crack? Hardly the kind of thing appropriate for a family movie? What does being the leader of the tribe actually mean?According to her grandfather's 'leader lessons', being a tribe leader means nothing more than practicing for war. That's all he teaches. War, war, war. What's that got to do with sitting on the back of a whale and riding about the ocean? I don't know much about Maori tribes but I think that this is a completely outrageous representation of them. This could be intentional as the grandfather is supposed to be out of touch with his true tribal senses but nothing excuses the scene in which he tells a group of 10-year-old boys to place their severed enemy's heads on a stick as an example to others. I'm sorry but there is a word for that kind of behaviour. It's called 'WAR CRIMES'. Another thing I think is totally inappropriate for a family movie. And it's also pretty Xenophobic.What boggles the mind is how I've heard of so many people telling me they cried at this film. Cried at WHAT exactly? There is no major emotional revelation at any part of the film. The ending is totally inconclusive. Just a bunch of guys in a big boat, chanting. Why would I cry at this? And where are they going?I will give the film credit for having a few brief (very brief) atmospherical moments during the narration scenes. But nothing ever becomes of them. There is no complication or sophistication to this film at all. It builds and 'resolves' in the most simplistic and dull way. I would not recommend this as a family movie. I was hoping for something better than mass-produced rubbish such as 'Cheaper by the Dozen' and I did not get it.Don't be fooled or brainwashed by the inexplicably positive reviews this film has somehow garnered. That is my most crucial advice.The DVD is presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with a Dolby 5.1 soundtrack (that might as well be Mono for all it's worth).",1.0,0.2105263157894736,2,1,-0.296,negative,-0.9898,very negative,2004,2,28

152064,0792844890,A3OD7GOXPSO9Z,2,31,2012-08-17,Spacebollocks,"There comes a time as a moviegoer where you watch a shoddy movie by a talented director and be dumbstruck on how he could make such a horrible picture. Such is the case with Mel Brooks. It's amazing how Mel Brooks could go from creating great comedy classics like ""Young Frankenstein"" (1974) and ""Blazing Saddles"" (1974) to producing undignified garbage like ""Spaceballs"" (1987).How this pile of horse manure has a huge fanbase is beyond me. Then again, Nickelback has a lot of fans too so one shouldn't be surprised if a popular piece of crap is endorsed by a legion of fans. What IS a surprise is how terribly unfunny this movie is. I've watched many comedies that are both popular and critically acclaimed and I never sat through one in complete silence. Watching ""Spaceballs"" is like being a cancer-ridden patient and hearing doctors make jokes about your illness; it's painful enough to make you contemplate suicide.People say that the jokes in this movie are hit-and-miss. How about miss-and-failed completely? I mean, come on: Pizza the Hutt? Barf? Yogurt? Dark Helmet? Snotty? Lame ""Planet of the Apes"" and ""Alien"" references at the end? What is this? Junior high? Look, I'm not expecting a completely tasteful parody but there's bad taste and jokes that are tastelessly bad. Watching Lone Star duel with Dark Helmet in a blatantly phallic lightsaber duel (Wow, that's so funny. Not.) makes you loan for the days when Gene Wilder and Cleavon Little were destroying backstage sets in the Warner Bros. studio.In ""Spaceballs"", the central targets of ridicule are, of course, the ""Star Wars"" trilogy and science-fiction in general. Now, I would use ridicule in a very loose sense since the movie is absolutely pathetic as a parody. This movie had a lot of opportunities and ways to ridicule science-fiction and the ""Star Wars"" trilogy in particular (George Lucas' riffing of Joseph Campbell mythologies, the constantly bizarre but memorable acting and one-liners, the ridiculously overzealous fans, sci-fi movies' overemphasis on visual effects instead of characterization, the simplistic good vs. evil plot device, the ongoing ""Star Wars"" vs. ""Star Trek"" feud, the over-analysis of cryptic symbols like the monolith from ""2001"", just to name a few) and if given a good script, it would have worked.But instead of deconstructing the genre the same way ""Young Frankenstein"" and ""Blazing Saddles"" did to horror and western genres respectively, ""Spaceballs"" just throws one lame joke after another, neither of which is helped by the mediocre performances from the cast. The only joke in the movie that is genuinely funny is the scene where Yogurt sells the ""Spaceballs"" merchandise to the cast, a blatant mockery of the ""Star Wars"" merchandising machine. Too bad none of the other jokes had the same bite or wit.Both a giant missed opportunity and a complete shambles as a comedy, ""Spaceballs"" is a shameful failure that would never be so cherished if it wasn't for the director involved in it. Science fiction deserves a better parody than ""Spaceballs"".Strongest recommendation to avoid.",1.0,0.064516129032258,1,1,0.0,neutral,-0.9932,very negative,2012,8,17

In the trailer, it is said that ClayBoy becomes a man that summer.  Read: he has sex for the first time.  Have we gotten that stupid that we think having sex makes a boy a man?

His two friends (Steve Zahn and Jack Black) do whatever is necessary to win back their old buddy, which twists and turns into silly acts of desperation.My problem with this movie is that it uses uncreative extremes to get laughs.

890467,B0007TKNJW,A1P1FO7K4WKXMX,10,20,2005-12-26,Crash and burn,"I was ecstatic when one of my fond childhood memories had finally been released on DVD.  How could I have been so incredibly wrong?I remember Kansas City Bomber serving up an abundance of thrills and chills and gripping drama on and off the roller derby ring, but having recently seen it as an adult it was like a test of endurance to make it all the way to the end of the disc. I'm not trying to be overly dramatic when I say this movie was horrible. If there was an actual screenplay involved it must have been written within a twenty-four hour deadline.Here's an example of how nonsensical the screenplay is. Early in the movie we hear rumors that KC's roommate/teammate was traded because of it possibly having something to do with KC's lusty relationship with the team owner.  KC is appalled at even the mere thought of such a thing and she takes action to confronts the owner head-on. The first thing he says is ""Of course that's not the reason I traded her!"" and the seccond thing he says is ""OK, so maybe I was a bit jealous she gets to spend more time with you than I do"",. And KC basically says something like ""Well, you could have been a bit nicer about it"", as they both carry on with the rest of their happy-go-lucky day. It's simply absurd!! First, why would the owner kick a player off of the team all because it's his lover's roommate--esspecially when he plans to give her her own swanky little nest on the water?? And what happened to KC going to save her teammates position on the team?? Incredibly muddled writing.The action scenes in the ring would have been great if it weren't for Welch's big, mannish stunt woman overtly and clumsilly hiding her face with a wig and keeping her head facing the ground. There's no second guessing which shots feature Welch mainly because Welch isn't really doing much of anything that resembles action. As a matter of fact much of the roller derby action was handled with corny cartoon buffoonery. This movie makes the WWF look like the Ultimate Fighting Championship.And then there's KC's seasoned old rival who's bitter towards KC because she knows KC is there to take her crown as the roller queen. It's just a one note performance of a woman grousing and crying in her beer and any scene that begins to give us a glimpse into who this woman is/was quickly turns into a sloppy meaningless fight scene. And all the men in the movie (with the exception of the gentle giant Hank) are relegated to being rude, crude, crotch-grabbing, raping neanderthals.This is just the shell of a movie. It's also the seed of a GOOD movie. Unfortunately the only thing that grew out of this one is stink weed. And what an insult to Rachel Welch's career to even infer this was the greatest roll of her career.  You don't have to be a rocket scientist to know the studio's main objective was to find yet another action-packed way of selling Welch's undeniable sex appeal in a tight outfit and THAT they were successful in.",1.0,0.5,1,1,-0.4019,negative,-0.9656,very negative,2005,12,26
542831,B00003CY5D,A21JSZ93WD1KPR,3,15,2006-03-23,A little too realistic. Do we really need CGI to give us bad drama?,"""A special effect without a story behind it is a pretty boring thing."" --George LucasCase in point, Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within.It begins as so many Hollywood sci-fi movies do: with the success of a video game. Then a flimsy movie plot is formed in the way so many Hollywood sci-fi plots are: from a gross misinterpretation of a sceintific concept, in this case, the Gaia theory. From there, we the audience should expect nothing more or less than a mindless mess of brain-candy. To our surprise, this time, what do we get? A lot of bad drama, performed by computer animated people. Wha? Where did we go wrong?Seeing real people do bad acting is hard enough, but it's worse when a team of CGI animators try to get you to take their art seriously by creating CGI soap-opera.This film was marketed as the cutting edge of CGI, promising to dazzle everyone with the level of realism achieved. The trailers wowed us with animations that looked, wow! Like real people!But this begs the question: So what? Who needs animated people that do the same things real people do? The characters in this movie aren't flying around like Superman, aren't dodging bullets like Neo in ""The Matrix,"" and aren't amputees like Captain Dan in ""Forrest Gump."" They are just behaving like regular old bad actors in an insufferably bad B-movie. CGI has apparently gotten a little too real. We get more than enough bad drama from real actors already.Of all the reasons I can think of to use CGI actors instead of real ones (budget considerations, convenience of not having to worry about human problems like acne, illness, death of actors), none of them have anything to do with why I, as an audience member, should want to sacrifice my time and money to sit through what the filmmakers are selling.Sure, the CGI effects are impressive. But are impressive special effects enough to hold me for two hours?No. Ten or twenty minutes, maybe. A half-hour if the effects are reeeally dazzling. And that's an important point. When I go to a fireworks display or a laser show, I expect a mind-blowing array of light and sound. Maybe Final Fantasy would have been more entertaining if the creators had tried a little harder to give a good light show as opposed to a serious drama. By trying to have it both ways, they wound up with a mediocre effects show and a dull story. Why? To try to give computer animation an air of legitimacy? Who knows? And ultimately, who cares? Bad drama is bad drama, and it's even worse when it's CGI bad drama.CGI is useful for aiding a story. If the story sucks, all the CGI in the universe is not going to change that.

Conductor Schonwandt leads a sloppy, erratic performance. Often much too fast for the poor singers who struggle just to get all their words out. The first occurrence of the Giants motif is taken so fast, it might as well be a country gig, certainly not ""firmly measured"" like the composer indicated. (The short sixteenth notes almost sound double-dotted at this unreasonable speed). From the singers, the best impression vocally is the lovely voice of the Wotan, Johan Reuter. The rest are not much to write home about, and the top Rheinmaiden is just dreadful. Erda seems to have a fine voice, but the conductor merely had her sing mezzo voce with no support. What was the point of that?But, by today's standards, these vocal forces might not be the deal breaker. That odious honor belongs to the Director. Kaspar Bech Holten was 36 years old at the time of this Copenhagen Ring, and judging by these videos, it is a pity he was ever allowed out of the sandbox.I am truly saddened when I read viewers praising how these type of productions stimulate them and bring so much more insight and sensitivity than those hackneyed stagings of yesteryear etc etc etc.... I am saddened because these people are running away from encountering the music drama on its own terms, and the only way they will attend the opera house is if there is something controversial, shocking, or modernized. They trivialize the Ring by pasting on torturous symbols, equivalencies, hidden ""meanings"" by making it more ""relevant"" for us. At least, that is their stated purpose.But to put it briefly, what the audience will come away with is not a deeper insight into Wagner and his music, but rather an undesired glimpse into the neurotic fetishes of the Directors.Equally depressing, there are countless disconnects between music and ""concept"".For example... Loge is the god of Fire, mercurial, brilliant, clever, mischievous. Wagner's music is quick-silver, constantly in motion with shimmering chromatic movement. How does that square with Copenhagen's dour-faced Loge, who gets bogged down with always scribbling down notes (hmnn, must be not too bright?) and constantly chain-smoking. The armchair intellectuals will say ""ah, he smokes because he is the god of Fire. I've made a connection. How clever!"" Well, I was just waiting for the god of Fire to keel over in a coughing and retching fit. Unwarranted and idiotic as the killing of Loge by Wotan was in the last scene, I admit I secretly enjoyed it because watching him smirk and scowl through the whole show made me want to throttle him myself.Wotan... all powerful king of the gods?? Wotan, who in Die Walk&uuml;re kills Hunding with a contemptuous wave of his hand, here indulging in sadistic high school sport of burning his cigarette into the neck of the enchained Alberich? How regal is that? And pray tell, just what ""interesting"" does it tell you about Wotan's character? Also, to show Wotan on all fours selfishly gnawing on an apple is just distasteful and comical. No wonder Wagner did not indicate anything like that in his specific stage directions. If the Director and his admiring sheep want to play at opera, go ahead and write your own. Don't mess with genius.(Tell me, how many aficionados of Mozart were out there in the general population before trendy ""Amadeus"" pictured him as a vulgar buffoon? Do we really need to have genius brought down to the mob level before we will listen?)What does it really tell us to see Wotan pull Alberichs' pants down, or to see the buck-naked swimmer as the Rheingold in the first scene... except maybe some wish fulfillment on the part of Kaspar Bech Holten?The three powerful scene interludes go for nothing as we are forced to watch the same intrusive and boring videos of Br&uuml;nnhilde thumbing through all those books in Wotan's library. (She is ""Wotan's Wille"" after all, she knows all Wotan's innermost thoughts and desires. Why on earth would she need to do research in a celestial Bibliotheca?) Non-existent is the primal thrill of the Rhein prelude building by wave and wave... gone is the terror of the Descent into Nibelheim and the later Ascent to Valhalla. When the ensemble of anvils occurs, it makes a pitiful impression like tinkling Jingle Bells.I am a professional conductor and have encountered too much of this crap, especially in Germany. I once suggested to a Stage Director let's have a moratorium on all your ""concept""-driven stagings and instead allow conductors to substitute violins with synthesizers, and other instruments with bass guitars etc, and let's reverse all the tempos. She was not amused.And then there is the irritating high school level of directing where the characters not singing are mouthing some other conversations to each other. I suppose this was to lend ""verisimilitude"" like they sing in Gilbert and Sullivan. What a poverty of imagination and resorting to common effects. Ugh! how amateurish.I am posting this review only of Das Rheingold because I could not subject myself to watch the following operas. I suggest the same course for all.However, if you would like to see how an intelligent approach can unite a vibrant, creative presentation and still keep true to Wagner and his music, try the Met's LaPage Ring or the Mehta Valencia Ring.

1291588,B002VECLVO,A2NE9XC4XAE5HA,41,114,2010-02-08,Suicide Is One Thing -- But Making A Mess Is Just Not Done,"Fashion mogul Tom Ford, in his film directing debut, turns Christopher Isherwood's sharp little ""day in the life"" novel into a ""last day in the life"" film. Isherwood's George goes about his day, a day like any other, filled with the thousand little indignities and annoyances that flesh is heir to. Annoying children from next door, condescending neighbors, (mostly) uncomprehending students in his literature class, etc. George's Englishness and his homosexuality give him an outsider's view on life in Los Angeles, and Isherwood acts as an invisible nameless narrator, supplying some good observation about George and his milieu. Isherwood's George isn't having the best day; he seems to be aware that he's just going through the motions, almost on auto-pilot, and it seems to have something to do with his recently deceased partner of 16 years, Jim.In short, there isn't much plot in Isherwood's novel, and Ford can't be blamed for making George's seeming depression over the loss of his partner the focus of his film. Ford's George (played by Colin Firth, doing the best he can) is more than just bummed, he's actually preparing to kill himself. He leaves out the clothes he wants to be buried in, he prepares a series of Last Notes to assorted people, buys ammunition for the gun he keeps in his desk, and is shown throughout the day getting ready to check out once and for all.Okay, well and good, not necessarily a bad notion in and of itself. The problem is Ford's need to make each scene, each shot, each bloody frame even, into a big display of every known cinematic technique, ranging from simple things like slow motion to the more advanced gimmick of manipulating the color saturation in the image to convey George's emotional state. One of the most tasteless moments in the film occurs in a bar when George is approached by a young man, cuing the color to go from muted but natural tones (George is Sad) to bright vibrant full color (George is Horny). It comes off less as an instance of an interesting use of color than as an instance of Directorial Authority Run Amuck. Clearly, this film is an expression of STYLE over anything as mundane as mere Life. Ford can't bear to show any disorder in the world he brings to the screen, every image is faultlessly composed and immaculately lit, hermetically created for maximum glossy photo-spread effect. Even a display of plastic pencil sharpeners in college bookstore is carefully arranged, with the little plastic items arrayed in precise color-specific rows. A scene of George unable to pull the trigger of the gun he has in his mouth, evidently out of concern for the damage he'll do to his surroundings, at first comes off as just a spectcularly ill-advised bit of black comedy, but unexpectely winds up being emblematic of the entire film. Suicide is one thing, but mess will simply not be tolerated.There's more. It isn't enough for George to strike up an impromptu chat with one of his neighbor's children, whom he has unexpectedly met at the bank. The little girl has to have a stylish entrance, glimpsed in the reflection of an impossibly over-polished floor, followed by a slow shot travelling up her body from bottom to top, with music clearly inspired by Bernard Herrmann's score to VERTIGO on the soundtrack, yet. The entire movie is nothing but this kind of flourish, over and over and over, little nudges from Ford so we can applaud how ""cinematic"" his film is. The nudges start to bruise, before long, and the urge to nudge back can't be denied. The film feels completely unnatural and mechanical, so composed and created and finally phony that AVATAR comes off as a gay lark tossed off as an afternoon's merry diversion in comparison. It is difficult to give a damn about anyone in the film when they're just a bunch of carefully pretty immaculately groomed and dressed (and undressed) puppets. That this is true of even George's relationship with the late Jim (played by the pretty but useless Matthew Goode, who last annoyed as Ozymandias in WATCHMEN) is a particularly grave failing. The flashbacks we get of George and Jim together (reading in cozy domesticity, or sitting in carefully composed and overly styled B/W Bruce Weber-esque splendor on a picturesque outcropping of rock) are pretty standard romance novel stuff. There's no accounting for soul mates, I guess, but I think I'd have preferred not seeing Jim at all to the overly posed scenes we get here, which seem to have been cribbed out of an upscale gay magazine all-male resort ad.It all just thuds and plods along, with a ponderous funereal air that really gets oppressive. The film hasn't gotten the complaints that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN got, that it offers too negative a view of Homosexuality As Misery, but I doubt that A SINGLE MAN will get enough popular attention to warrant many complaints. I'm tempted to dismiss the film as TERMS OF ENDEARMENT for the Project Runway crowd. I have to admit that I was glad to see an actor of Colin Firth's abilities being allowed to carry a film, one at least nominally intended for grown ups. To be fair, Firth's scene where he gets the Awful Phone Call about Jim's passing is most impressive, by far the most memorable thing in the film. But even Firth's performance falls into the black hole of Ford's style, as closeup after closeup of George displaying Subtle Emotions become as cloying as the film they had, up until then, been the best part of.",1.0,0.3596491228070175,1,1,-0.7184,very negative,0.9902,very positive,2010,2,8

As normal I tend to focus and award stars on the product and not the movie.Firstly it must be noted that Blackenstein is a low budget movie not expected to make big DVD revenue so I wasn't expecting a fully remastered product with loads of extras however what I got was below par.Most obvious is the 4:3 aspect ratio on the DVD compared to the original 1.85.1 AR in which it was produced (IMDB).  The lack of subtitles is also a big negative. The transfer is a bit below average and it looks like it has been taken off a VHS which might expalin the 4:3 aspect ratio.On the plus side the movie is pretty close to the original run time and also has the complete intro and credits that poor quality DVDs often lack. It does have a limited main menu with scene selection.I would have given this 3 stars but for the hefty price tag of $17. I picked up mine on discount for $4.55 which is closer to what it's worth.  It gets 2 stars.Unfortunately this is the only DVD copy out there so I would suggest fans of this movie wait until this release hits the bargain bins.,1.0,1.0,2,1,-0.4767,negative,0.6124,very positive,2013,3,9

There's nothing to say.""And indeed there is little to say about this flaccid, nonsensical remake of the classic cult horror movie. Little that's positive, anyway -- the movie stumbles around blindly, trying to give itself atmosphere with hokey tricks and silly-looking cinematography. Put simply, ""The Wicker Man"" is a big, weird mess.Cop Edward Malus (Nicholas Cage) is recuperating from a traumatic incident, which means he's not on top form when his ex-fiance Willow (Kate Beahan) gets in touch with him. Her child Rowan has vanished, and she wants Malus' help. And so he travels to a remote northern island, ruled by the matriarch Sister Summerisle (Ellen Burstyn).It seems that the people there are some kind of bizarre neopagan tribe, and the women all hate Malus. The few men there are basically second-class citizens. And as Malus comes closer to finding the little girl who may be his daughter, he discovers a horrifying secret -- which is waiting for him.Remaking anything is a tricky business, and ""The Wicker Man"" takes the worst possible approach -- it tries to bluster through. It has a lot to bluster about, because there's no suspense, no atmosphere, and no horror -- only a lame and unsuspenseful mystery, and a bad acid-trip finale, with lots of people in animal costumes.To make matters worse worse, it feels like it was scripted by several different people who never bothered to consult each other. Allusions -- like Malus' tape -- are dropped. The emotional appeal is trite. The metaphors and symbolism are appallingly blatant, until you feel that Cage's character must be the biggest idiot on the Pacific coast if he hasn't clued in yet.Director Neil LaBute obviously has no idea how to bring this celluloid Frankenstein's monster to life. So he dresses Cage in a furry costume and saddles the incoherent script with weird bee analogies and absurd dialogue (""Killing me won't bring back your g*dd*mn honey!""), apparently hoping that it will overcome the flimsy plot.Even worse, sometimes it gets unintentionally campy or funny, when it's actually being deadly serious. The most unintentionally funny moment of the movie comes when Burstyn dramatically says, ""Prepare the drone!"" near the climax. You'll be rolling off your seat.Cage himself comes across as confused and over-the-top (""How'd it get burnt?"" repeated over and over), and it's hard to care whether his character lives or dies. Burstyn does as well as can be expected, given that her matriarch is a pale shadow of Christopher Lee, and a pretty silly one at that. The other actors just sleepwalk through.Remakes are bad enough, but remakes of cult classics are simply unforgivable. It's not hard to see why this disjointed dud was a box-office disaster.(Merry Christmas to all!)",1.0,0.8846153846153846,2,1,0.0,neutral,-0.9742,very negative,2006,12,24

It should have never been made, becuase, what looks and sounds good in print, usually, doesn't translate well to the big screen (there are, of course, some exceptions - ""Lord of the Rings"", anyone?).

182186,1559409002,A2RN2AO4BE6F4K,7,35,2001-07-16,One of the Dead Girls Blinks in the Final Scene!,"Movie Summary: Mary Henry crawls from the muddy river after a car accident. Her two girl friends aren't so lucky. She seems to be in shock, but moves on with her life immediately. She leaves town for her new job as a church organist. She becomes increasingly haunted by a creepy figure that no one else can see as well as a smooth operator who lives across the hall in her boarding house. Mary's visions increase as she is drawn to an abandoned carnival outside of town where the dark figure is waiting for her.My Opinion:  One of the dead girls in the car at the end of the movie blinks in the final scene. It's not hard to see. This basically sums up the quality and feel of Carnival of Souls. What's all the fuss about? Well as far as I can tell it's a case of the emperor's new clothes. No one wants to admit that they don't like it, or that they find it stupid. Or they like it for the very fact that it is so bad. But more than not, a bad movie is just bad. Carnival of Souls is not scary now that you are all grown up, and not all that impressive unless you go into all the details about the budget and who made it. But that's not what you are here for. This is supposed to be entertainment. The comparison to a Twilight Zone episode with poor acting is right on. The pace is dreadfully slow as well. The base ideas for the story are intriguing for the time it was made, but Herk just didn't have the resources to pull it off then and the ideas are nothing new now.DVD Quality:  A very overblown criterion release for this title. Check out the Carnival of Souls/Horror Hotel double feature release instead.What You Should Do:  Rent it if you are a B (B for Bad) movie buff or are intrigued by all the hype. Do not be fooled by all the reviews touting how scary and great this film is. The &quot;no refunds&quot; policy that they had on this movie in the theaters in the 1960's was because it was so bad, not because it was so scary. Don't fall for the hype and buy it before you've seen it.

Though who can blame them for trying?  On paper, both films look disastrous: mega-budget, period chick flicks in which nearly everybody dies and everyone knows the ending.  But ""Titanic"" worked (for teen girls with deep pockets, at least), so why couldn't it work again?  Maybe with James Cameron at the helm and Leo in the cockpit it would have stood a chance, but with Bay and Bruckheimer calling the shots, it tanks.  As it stands, this film's singular achievement is to render one of the most significant, tragic and exciting episodes in American history completely and utterly boring.  Randall Wallace's dire screenplay with its tired love triangle and upbeat, ludicrously revisionist ending is more than half the problem, and a surprisingly unconvincing Ben Affleck accounts for most of the rest.  Cuba Gooding Jr - playing the most interesting character in the entire film - gets about three minutes screentime.  The trailer was great, and it might have made a nice music video if Faith Hill's power ballad didn't somehow manage to give you the creeps.  What's most disappointing is that everyone involved in this picture is capable of so much more than this (yes, even Ben). It's torture.

At a $50 list price for half a season's worth of episodes, the studio execs would be deemed insane by any court and institutionalized. This MUST be a mistake.Either the third season of PERRY MASON is going to be released in COMPLETE form for $49.99, or the price HAS TO be revised down.This is, as we all know, a quality program; the likes of which we rarely see today. However, a list price of 29.99 for half a season is PLENTY for a program whose original production costs 50 years ago were approximately 5% of what a program costs today (programs that are being released immediately at list prices of $59.99 or less for a complete season of 22 to 24 episodes).Who is getting rich off this? Raymond Burr's estate? Hardly. Barbara Hale? Don't make me laugh. Erle Stanley Gardner's estate is certainly getting residuals, but I doubt if anyone originally associated with the program is getting a cent in royalties.This means, that unlike currently made programs, where continuing royalty and syndication rights are arranged for actors, directors, writers and producers to continue long after the programs originally aired---costs which have to be considered in the list pricing of any series release, that---outside of the $1 or so that goes into packaging for each unit, another $1-$2 per unit in production costs, and less than $1 in transport and distribution costs (despite rising gas prices), the rest is pure profit for the studios.This means (IF the $49.99/half-season price tag IS true) that this is one of the biggest rip-offs yet.But I cannot believe this is true.

I've seen ""Airplane"" a million times, the Scary Movie franchise still makes me laugh, and the ""Naked Gun"" films were inspired and fresh.  Heck, even  ""Not Another Teen Movie"" had its funny moments.This film, on the other hand, simply falls flat.  I think the writers forgot that to make a spoof, they had to do more than just menetion the movie they are spoofing, or at least make the spoof moment somewhat satirical and entertaining.  It's like they made a list of all the films they wanted to make fun of and then couldn't come up with ways to make them funny.Examples:1)  We need to spoof Pretty Woman!  Let's have the male star dress up as a hooker and walk down Melrose in a flashback sequence!  Wait a minute, huh?  Why is the male star imitating a female prostitute again?2)  We need to spoof Meet the Parents!  I know, let's have the goofy Ben Stiller character knock down the urn with the mother's ashes in it, only THIS time, we'll have an entire dead body spill out of the urn instead of ashes.  Oh that will be a hoot!  And THEN we'll have the cat go and french kiss the dead body instead of pee on it.  That's hysterical!3)  We need to spoof Kill Bill!!  (Wait... what?  Is that even a date movie?)4)  We need to spoof Hitch. I know!  Let's have a dwarf play some guy named Hitch who gives love advice to our lead female.  Hysterical!5)  We need to spoof When Harry Met Sally.  I have a great idea.  For no reason at all, we'll start a dinner scene with our male star faking an orgasm (ridiculously I might add).  He won't be trying to prove a point or anything, he'll just be wailing around like a dying seal for no reason at all at the beginning of the scene.  That will get a huge laugh.6)  We need to spoof My Big Fat Greek Wedding.  So let's have our female be a member of a huge family, and we'll have her father be a black man and her mother be Indian.  That's too much humor right there folks.I could go on and on, but I think you get the point.  This movie doesn't hit the same, satirical notes that better spoof movies do.  It just succeeds in mentioning a bunch of date movies and making you feel sick to your stomach while at the same time feeling confused.

I mean seriously compared to THE DEFINETIVE D-day movie the Longest Day, SPR is stale one-sided soap opera which would rather tell a sappy sentimental fairy tale than explore a real important historic event. Every one raves about the impact of the first 20 minutes of Ryan (which are the only part worth watching) but seriously every time the camera pulled back to a wideshot there was only a handfull of GI's which totally lacks the real sense of scale of the mass invasion, captured in Longest Day's amazing invasion scenes and while SPR is more gritty than Longest Day (only because of cencorship at 1962 the time of LD's production), hey Steven I like my movies gorey and have seen alot more extreme gore in movies.Also the shear one-sided nature of this movie is hard to accept, I mean we see brave American's dying on the beach..........and that's it. Hey that did happen and I resept those people but this is no excuse for Speilberg to portray the landings like this when Allies of other countries died just as brutally on the same day a few miles away. Also the Germans are protrayed as these unseen cold blooded killers when in reality they were ordinary men desperately fighting what they knew would be a losing battle. I'm no Nazi but really in this day and age there is no need to protray Germans in this propaganda film way. In reality (convienently not told in SPR) the Germans got up in the morning to see literally thousands!!! of Allied ships which proceeded to bombard them, once again I hate Nazi's but the fact that they tried to hold their positions and not just turn around and run has got to be acknowledged. By diminishing the courage of the Germans this way Speilberg clearly paints them as 'bad guys' like in some campy Western.What proceeds after these landing scences is a sentimental and simple story. There is no depth to the plot or originality to the characters of Ryan and anyone who says there is must have had their eyes closed in the last 50 years to the 100's of other war flicks which have the 'Brave Comander from ordinary background' 'Ox the strong simpleton' 'Brooklyne the wise cracking NewYorker' and the 'weasle like coward'. Really the whole ""this time the mission is a man....."" or ""why risk our lives...."" are but simple cliched points that have being explored much better in other films and are handled with complete imcompetance by Speilberg who obviously think's this he's directing ET.For a real idea of the D-day landings watch the Longest Day, it is far superior and shows all sides in accurate detail. The only thing Ryan has going for it is the gore, if this was a horror movie critics would say it's disgusting and call for the film to be banned but when attached to a sappy flagwaving war film it becomes the 'Greatest war film ever made'. Hate to tell you but Apocalypse Now, while not realistic, is by far the greatest war film ever made and there are plenty of other films better than Ryan, Fullmetal Jacket, Tora tora tora, Platoon , and even his own Schindler's List.I mean without the gore and Speilberg's name attached to it, SPR has about as much value as Rambo or Missing in Action. Yet maybe thats what people want, a sentimental fairytale with good guys and bad guys, not a true factual examination of war. I mean Black Hawk Down is 100% genuine and has F/X technically superior to Ryan'S but that was no where near as successfull at the box office.",1.0,0.3880597014925373,2,4,-0.296,negative,-0.9771,very negative,2003,4,1

The end result would be the spitting image of Zombie Town, a direct-to-DVD movie that's far scarier for the fact that anyone would release it than for anything actually contained in the footage.Plot (if you can call it that): parasites have invaded a small town that, thanks to a tractor-trailer accident, is cut off from the rest of the world. Pretty neat setup, what? Parasites always attack at times like that. Especially if they turn people into zombies. And, as you can probably guess, a small group of misfits, most of whom don't like each other, is left to save the town (and the world) from being turned into parasite food.It's a well-trod plot, but as we've seen a number of times in the past few years (most recently with Dance of the Dead), given the right treatment it's still got quite a bit of life in it. This is not the right treatment by a longshot. Awful effects, unintentionally hilarious dialogue, a script that feels like it was thrown together in, and I'm being generous here, forty-five minutes.

The second was pretty much the same deal with a little less of a budget, a slightly weaker story, and an appearance of Kumar. Now we are brought to the third and hopefully last installment which lacks just about everything. Obviously the budget was way less since it was a straight to dvd release, the story was the same but with a few boring twists, and our scary ghost girl/brother have really lost their effect.The story picks up kind of where the second one left off. The apartment in Chicago where our asian ghosts have caused havoc is now forcing tenants to flee leaving it close to shutting down. Max is the manager of the complex who lives there with his two younger sisters. As he desperately tries to retain and gain new tenants he winds up becoming possessed by the spirits. As his sisters lives lay in the balance between the spirits and their possessed brother they are told they must do a ceremony to end the spell.Out of the series this by far is the worst of all.

The issues that the film brought up are just as relevant today if not more so, and the original film was a great piece of filmmaking from both an artistic and technical perspective.However, the injection of new CGI scenes, which do not match the original film whatsoever, destroy the integrity and potency of this once classic.  Although some of it is subtle, there are a lot of obvious scenes and CGI backgrounds, editing, and even characters.Unlike films of the same era with similar themes (such as Logan's Run) which exude 'cheesiness' and kitsch (they might be fun nonetheless), THX 1138 was one that stood up well with age due to its conservative and high quality visual design, focus on story and use of existing visual references.However, with these new scenes, the movie does seem cheesy and less believable.  The scenes do not match the movie and take away from the style.  They also give it today's overly literal, overdone visual cues and take away from the strong subtle tone of the movie.Other 'director's cuts' have editing changes, usually inserting scenes that were previously taken out.

Set in a school, it involves a misunderstood loner called Kathy who is cruelly taunted by her classmates, but takes revenge by means of psychic powers. So far, so ""Carrie"". But here, the cruel prank puts the victim into a coma, and it's from here that she wreaks havoc, which echoes ""Patrick"". She somehow manages to possess another student, who goes through the school leaving a trail of destruction and death on Kathy's behalf. Sounds great for Fulci fans, but don't hold your breath. The various revenge murders are all very unimpressive and often ridiculous, including a death by being scared of a museum and death by being confronted with a boyfriend's corpse! What's wrong with these people!? The film has no highlights of gore whatsoever, which is a major shortcoming in a Fulci film. Even it's set piece murder, a ""death by snails"" sequence will probably leave you laughing (how exactly do snails manage to overpower someone??). This, along with the film's title, makes me think that Fulci is actually trying to emulate Argento's far superior ""Phenomeona"". The film is generally pretty confusing, as Kathy's power, and her hold over the possessed girl are never properly explained. The acting is awful, the lead character (the possessed student) wanders around looking totally bored, so you won't really care about any of the characters. It's also ugly and dull to look at, even though Fulci tries to ape Argento yet again by bathing many shots in lurid coloured lighting, mostly a tiresome bright blue, but it just doesn't add up to anything coherent.

I've read the reviews, and discussed the films to death, and all I can say right now is... Halloween 8 doesn't look good.Firstly, let's clarify and correct a couple of things people have said in previous reviews... because this misinformation can sway you if you're not a hardcore follower of the series.* Halloween H20 (Part 7) did not negate or ignore the other parts in the series, namely part 4,5 and 6. It simply switched tracks. Part 4,5 and 6 all focused on Jamie Lloyd (Michael's niece) and the Strode family in part 6. Jamie because as far as we the audience (and Michael presumably) were aware, she was the only surviving family member. And the Strode family as they were residing in Michael's house. Of course, there was also Jamie's baby in part 6... but depending on which version of Halloween 6 you watch (yes, there is a producer's cut aswell), this plot element takes you in 2 different directions.- Of course in Halloween H20, we simply switch back to Laurie Strode, (this is not necessarily negating or ignoring the other parts)... and we learn that she simply faked her death to evade Michael.* We don't know at this time that Michael didn't get his head cut off in part 7. Some have speculated that it would be someone else in the mask. How stupid is this? if you're trying to kill someone, where's the logic in disguising someone else as you while you ""escape""? that's not trying to kill someone is it?- And even if it was someone else, why didn't that person speak to Laurie or remove thier mask as they stood there pinned to the tree branch by the van? They did have use of thier arms afterall....So now we come to Halloween 8...Until this point, we've always had 1 or 2 characters that have been key characters to the reality of the series. We've had Loomis (Michael's doctor), Laurie (Michael's first original target), Jamie Lloyd and her baby (Remaining family) and Tommy Doyle (Kid turned Druid expert most relevant in part 6).All these characters in thier respective films have been essential to the strength of each Halloween movie. Without them... it would just be another stupid shallow teen slasher and would not have any of the mystique of Halloween.So what do we have to look foward to in H8? Well... considering that H20 was done is the modern PG rated non-gore low-scare teen slasher style, and that this time around we have no Loomis, Jamie or Tommy... It doesn't look good. We've got a model and a rapper I hear. Great, so it's going to be a stepping stone movie to improve the credentials of these 2 individuals. Actors make the best actors, not models or musicians.Even with Laurie (who is *rumoured*... and I stress *rumoured* going to die early in the film), the movie is going to struggle because the entire developement of the film revolves around her actions. Afterall... Michael's one goal is to kill her, his part is a simple one where he is a pawn to the curse of thorn. H20 struggled because of this. And H8 will too.They're going to really have to pull the cat out of the bag on this one to stop the movie from alienating it's original fans and sending the whole franchise down the gurgler.",1.0,1.0,1,4,-0.308,negative,-0.9965,very negative,2002,2,1

I mean, it didn't come out in theaters (at least in the U.S.), which is never a good sign, no movie store seems to have it in stock, and I read some pretty crippling reviews right here on good ol' Amazon.  But hey, I gave it a shot.  Boy, was that a mistake...First of all, here's a quick synopsis: Years ago, King Hrothgar (Stellan Skarsgard) killed a troll, but took pity on the troll's son, Grendel (Ingvar Eggert Sigurosson), and left him alone.  Grendel, now full-grown, is seeking revenge on Hrothgar's kingdom.  Hearing of Hrothgar's plight, the fierce warrior Beowulf (Gerard Butler) comes to help the king kill Grendel.  Along the way Beowulf meets a witch/prostitute named Selma (Sarah Polley) and discovers that trolls have feelings too.Now, we all know that Stellan Skarsgard and Gerard Butler are great actors, but in this movie they fumble with a halting and painfully corny script.  The script affects the acting, and the acting affects the film.Secondly, though Sarah Polley is a lovely actress, she seems very misplaced in this film.  She's the ONLY character with an American accent and, in an age-old Anglo-Saxon myth, this is very, very out of place.  In addition, the small amount of weight that Gerard Butler has put on around the stomach area draws a little from his role as an unstoppable, highly-trained warrior.The battle scenes are unnecessarily gory, with fake-looking and very blood-soaked limbs flying left and right.  They seem primitive compared to the battle scenes of other films.  The scene in which Beowulf fights Grendel's mother is especially bad - there's lots of shrieking and strobe-light-esque movements that seem almost comical in this day and age.The only things that can be said in this movie's defense are that the sweeping Iceland landscapes are breathtaking and the Celtic monk (Eddie Marsan) is mildly-amusing in his efforts to convert everyone.1-star...please don't waste 103 minutes of your life on this film.",1.0,0.4545454545454545,1,1,0.0,neutral,-0.9763,very negative,2006,11,11

It's amazing to believe the studio that produced memorable classics could turn out a movie as bad as this (yes, it's worse than HERCULES and TREASURE PLANET).  The wire-thin storyline, which involves barnyard animals on the trail of an outlaw who can hypnotize animals by singing (huh?) is needlessly stretched out for 76 minutes (which is 70 minutes too long) with forced, unfunny gags, frantic but lifeless sequences and lame characterizations.  The animation, usually a high point in a Disney feature, is both pedestrian and unappealing to look at.  Alan Menken supplies the music, but like the movie, his tunes are banal, insepid, and unappealing, even weaker than his work for HERCULES.  Failed Disney cartoons don't have to be this horrific; case in point:  THE BLACK CAULDRON and ATLANTIS-THE LOST EMPIRE fell short financially and were flawed, but both movies made an attempt to be something more complex and adult-oriented than typical Disney fare (I actually liked both of those films).  This film, on the other hand, is a big step backward, and the hectic, pedestrian execution ultimately cripples it.  It was disheartening that this was declared at the time to be Disney's last traditionally animated feature, and even more unfortunate that they chose to go out with a flop as insidious as this.  Uncle Walt would surely turn over in his grave if he found out his studio ever produced this film.  Luckily, John Lasseter would salvage the Disney animation studio's reputation with better titles, as HOME ON THE RANGE, hideous as it was, proved not to be the final nail in the coffin for Disney after all.",1.0,0.5,1,2,-0.6249,very negative,-0.9615,very negative,2007,6,14

The film bore no relationship to the Sherlock Holmes created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. This 'divorce from reality' was compounded by a number of scenes attempting to show Holmes as a master of action/fisticuffs (quasi 'Lethal Weapon"") - carried to such inane and inconsistent levels that even teenagers would be put off. As for the plot, an 18th century version of a James Bond movie villain attempting world takeover, it also lacked credibility; it was also difficult to understand the mumbling dialogue. Finally, in a final attempt to somehow cover up all the silliness, the audience is also 'treated' to 18th-century science-fiction involving transmitted signals, and some sort of quasi-romance involving Holmes and the former leading bad girl.

Evidently that day has not yet come, because here we are in 2007 with Transformers.A person can ooh and ahh all they like about Transformers admittedly phenomenal special effects, but it still doesn't make a bad movie any less of a bad movie.  It's truly a sad statement when the cartoon Transformers movie which was made over twenty years ago trumps this big, loud, brainless mess in every way.  That film had an much deeper story, greater emotional impact and far better characters than this overblown train wreck even came close to.What I wanted going into Transformers was simply a great action movie.  My expectation was that the subject matter would be taken seriously and that the tone would be appropriate for a good action movie.  What I got instead, was an emphasis on misplaced ""American Pie"" style humor, thrown in no doubt, to appeal to the lowest common denominator of american movie going audiences.  (A trend which seemed to plague the bulk of 2007's summer blockbusters.) I also got an awful lot of unnecessary Michael Bay grandstanding and self indulgence.  (The director even went so far as to pat himself on the back with a shout out to ""Armageddon"".)Simply put, Optimus Prime, Bumble Bee and the rest deserved a far better movie than this.  I knew the film was in trouble the minute I heard the great Optimus Prime reduced to uttering such character insulting lines as ""my bad"".  I watched the film in utter embarrassment as the noble autobots bumbled around like complete idiots outside the main character's home trying to hide in the dark while inside the home, mom and dad were busy accusing young Sam of masturbating in his bed room.  I was made to squirm in my seat each time the poster boy character for ""product placement in disguise""-Frenzy, appeared on screen to transform into yet another product for us to buy, quickly becoming the most obnoxious character in film since Jar Jar Binks.I honestly can't believe this movie has reviewed as well as it has.  I guess because of this, we can probably look forward to more of the same mindless idiocy from the inevitable sequel.

858557,B000642008,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,3,13,2005-03-17,We ain't out there to make friends.,"In my part of Virginia NASCAR is as common as Peanut Butter in a grocery store.  Everywhere you go, you are going to see it.  It is either on cars, on shirts, on billboards, or anywhere else that your eyes may wonder.  Most of the material still pays respect to the number ""3"" and the driver that will forever be missed.  It pulls people to the track to see that number and thankfully everyone can profit off the commercial success of this driver's death.  Sadly, ESPN also did this and the result was the ill-fated made-for-TV-movie, 3: The Dale Earnhardt Story starring the ""I need work bad"" actor, Berry Pepper.  Literally racing through the life of this legend, this film boasts a simple 88 minutes and vaguely covers whatever it can to give rabid fans just a taste of this man's life.  Instead of giving him the proper respect, ESPN uses clich&eacute;s and over-bearing family moments that just scream ""made-for-TV"".  With Pepper's accent fading in and out within races, you cannot help but laugh at this cheaply designed model created by director Russell Mulcahy.So, what went wrong with this film?  Since the word ""everything"" will not cover all of it, I will attempt to explain in some detail.  I cannot stress this fact enough that if an actor looks like the person that you are trying to portray, it does not mean that he or she will do a good job (see the Charlize Theron theory).  This goes for Barry Pepper, who just never really gave Earnhardt any personality.  I felt like I was watching the story of one of those paper cutout dolls.  Sure, his costumes and appearance would change, but nothing else would.  His motions and emotions were forced and never really felt like I was watching the life of NASCAR's greatest, but instead seeing an actor do an impersonation of someone that he admires.  Pepper would not have Executive Produced this film if he wasn't already an Earnhardt fan (or at least could see the $$ made from the death of a human).  The same could be said about the rest of the actors in this film.  The children felt and sounded like paper mache, never quite seeming that comfortable in front of the camera ... especially Dale Jr.  I felt as if a gust of wind could have made him cry.  In fact, all the performances in this film coupled with a gust of wind made me cry.As I mentioned earlier, the timing on this film seemed very off.  How can you successfully measure the power of a man in a short span of 88 minutes?  There is just no way that you are going to be able to cover the depth and emotional excitement in this short time.  So, the creative team behind this film chose to ignore these moments and extend the racing scenes.  The outcome was literally horrible.  There was no balance, there was no craft, there was nothing actually paying respect to this man.  The story is where I could see the minds of the cash hungry people just getting bigger and bigger because they were going to do a story about a man life that millions would want to see.  They would want to see it not because it was good, but because the Earnhardt name was solely attached to it.  For a non-NASCAR fan like myself, this was kind of sad.  How can you have the life of Howard Hughes pushing three hours, and NASCAR powerhouse Dale Earnhardt just 88 minutes?  I guess you can over compensate by giving the viewers some extra features to the DVD, but for me that just didn't work.  The story was sloppy and completely disgraced Earnhardt's name.Overall, this proved to me that if you give a bunch of rednecks a camera, this is the quality of work that they will produce.  This was one of the worst autobiographical stories that I have seen in a very long time, even for the likes of ""made for TV"" it was horrible.  There was nothing redeemable in this story that I could go back to friends or family and say, ""Well, this part was kinda neat"".  There was nothing of the sort here.  I walked away from the film with less of an understanding about Earnhardt and his NASCAR business.  Even if you are a huge NASCAR fan, I do not think you will see the value in this film.  I especially love reading other reviews that say that this was a great film, but lacked some major elements to Dale's life.  Isn't that like a double negative?  Good film, but somehow you forgot to mention this?  I think some are just too generous with this story.  I am sad that he died, but this is not the way to pay respect to the man's life.Grade: * out of *****",1.0,0.2307692307692307,3,1,0.4767,positive,0.9938,very positive,2005,3,17

You would think that when translating a novel about people who are the great movers of the world into a movie, the cast would be full of great actors with a great screenplay to work with and great director to guide the process. Who is John Galt? More like, where are the actors from the previous installment? And, why is Part 2 so much worse than the already dreadful Part 1? Surely, no one can blame the actors (and I use that term loosely) from Part 1 from trying to save their careers (and I use that term loosely) by refusing to appear in Part 2. With a completely new cast for Part 2, it was as if the casting director deliberately made the worst possible casting decisions in an effort to sully the most important points of Rand's seminal book. [A quick Google search found the director's convoluted reason for the cast change, but I prefer to think that the actor from Part 1 asked for more money to be in Part 2 and were refused, which would be laughable for a film attempting to praise free market capitalism.] While terrible casting sometimes results in a movie that is unintentionally so bad it's good, this movie is not that kind of movie due to the low, very low, production values. Was that a model plane in the opening sequence? Are you kidding me? I got past that but was soon infuriated by a cameo by Fox News pundit Sean Hannity, whose intellectual qualifications barely surpass those of a bag of peanuts. I'm pretty sure Rand would vomit at the thought of Hannity in an Atlas Shrugged movie, especially when you consider it is people like Hannity who have hijacked Rand's message about capitalism while conveniently ignoring Rand's moral philosophy, to which Rand's vision of capitalism is married. (This was Part 1's greatest flaw as well.) Amusingly, fans of an unrestricted free market economy who say they have but never really did read Atlas Shrugged seem to think the acting and this movie in general is stellar, which is to say they think Linda Lovelace and Deep Throat should have won an Oscars. This movie is an abomination, but not inexplicably so if you consider that the director had no idea what the finer points of Rand's philosophies actually were.

In his hands, Holmes comes off more deranged than clever, less a genius than an insufferable oaf.  Thankfully, The Hound of the Baskervilles survives his savage lunacy because its real star is Dr. Watson (played exceptionally well by Kenneth Welsh).  Mercifully, Holmes/Frewer is off camera most of the time.  As for the other two features, someone must have told Frewer to tone it down because his antics are more restrained in these productions.  Still, there is that dreadful penchant of his for over emphasizing certain words with an accent that comes and goes.

Of course, he does and manages to bust into her room (thanks to the incompetent security guards).  He chases her down the hall and up the stairs to the roof.  As soon as he steps into a remote-controlled knoose, Laurie pushes the button and has him hanging upside down.  He ends up dropping the knife, which Laurie picks up and has a little chat with him.  She tells him he has failed because she is no longer afraid of him and no longer afraid to die.  She then proceeds to cut the rope, but stops when Michael starts grabbing his head like the paramedic did at the end of H20.  This leads Laurie to believe that she may be killing another innocent person, so she makes the dumb mistake of going over to Michael and trying to pull off the mask just ""to be sure"" (like she knows what his face looks like anyway).  Sure enough, it was just a trick.  Michael grabs Laurie, the rope breaks and he takes her down with him (regaining the knife in the process).  He ends up hanging on to the rope with one hand and stabbing her in the back with the other.  Laurie then kisses Michael, says ""I'll see you in Hell"", and then falls into the trees in slow motion (accompanied by some dramatic score, thus crafting a pathetic attempt at making it seem like such a good ending for her).The only time I accept the demise of heroes and heroines is when they die trying to do good.  If Laurie had died trying to save somebody or something like that, then I would have accepted it.  But no!  Laurie Strode died because she was stupid.  What made her think she was about to kill an innocent person?  He busted down her door with his bare hands and came after her with a knife.  She should have either cut that rope or let him hang.  Also, how did Michael know the paramedic felt his head, and what was all that jive about him ""failing""?  It seems to me like HE won the battle.I think Jamie Lee Curtis is a terrific actress, but I am very disappointed in her.  She made a very poor decision which I find to be quite insulting to the character that made her what she is today.  I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to watch another movie with her again.  It is too grim a reminder.  I have an excellent idea for the next HALLOWEEN, but due to the fact that I am an inexperienced screenwriter (still learning), I doubt I can strike a deal with the owners.  Too bad, because I would have brought Laurie back and sent her off with a bang.P.S. Yes, I do have this movie, but only for collecting.  Guess how many times I have actually watched it.",1.0,0.0,1,4,-0.4404,negative,-0.9966,very negative,2002,7,16
1562087,B008JFUPFI,A39W3263A9HCMN,12,47,2013-10-27,Man of SNORE,"Please bear in mind that I am a fan of both Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan. I'll spend pretty much every day until my terminal breath defending Sucker Punch and Snyder's Watchmen adaptation. Nolan's work with the Batman movies is nothing short of absolutely amazing and he has one eye for a tragic superhero story. He turned the story of Bruce Wayne into a beautiful tragic story of a man who must choose heroism or sanity. Watchmen is the story of former superheroes who realize that even though they're retired, they have a lot of saving to do- themselves for a starting point. And so when you take Superman and give it a dark spin, it's bound to succeed, right?Absolutely wrong.Alright, so maybe the movie isn't bad. If you're a pedestrian viewer wanting an explosion filled action movie, then you'll get that here. But for us Superman fans, it's a disgrace. I don't know who these &#34;fans&#34; are telling us that this is close to the graphic novels, in fact the way they adapted the comics is among some of the most appalling adapting work I've ever seen. There are problems right off the bat when Jor-El is stabbed to death by General Zod. REALLY? If anyone has even read the comic books, you'd realize that Jor-El is much stronger and more defensive than that. But it doesn't stop thereTo begin with, the Superman is greatly raped with a stove pipe and executed Tarantino- style throughout. He spends the whole movie angsting and whining. It's as annoying as The Tenth Doctor's final episode of Doctor Who. Alright, that's a little dramatic, sure. But half the exchanges between Clark Kent and people around him consist of:PERSON X: Clark, can we talk? CLARK: I don't want to. PERSON X: Look Clark, nothing is wrong with you. CLARK: I know. PERSON X: so why don't you send your powers to the world? CLARK: No, you don't understand. People CAN'T know who I am. They'll reject me.Every time one of these rubbish soap opera dialogues rung out over the cinema speakers, I groaned. To be fair, it is SLIGHTLY true to the comics, but they take it up to 11 here and it's unnecessary. The cutting of the film is really off here too. One minute, Superman is being interrogated, the next he's in the desert. It comes off as if Snyder dropped the script on the ground one day thus messing up the pages, then decided, &#34;ah, never mind, let's just shoot it like this&#34;. Your head will explode trying to make sense of this thing, man.And then there's the second half, filled with nothing but action, explosions, Superman pushing General Zod through several buildings (I laughed several times). The action itself is bloated, boring and incomprehensible too. Shaky camera and quick cutting combined with 3D, when I wasn't falling asleep, I was wondering what in the hot frak was going on. And then the climax, or lack of was just laughable.So, are there any positives? Well, the cast do a good job. I did like Henry Cavill a lot and I think given the terrible script that he had to work with, he did a decent job. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner are also great, but the highlight of the film is easily Michael Shannon as General Zod. He really knows how to make a bad guy scary- watch the film &#34;Bug&#34; for proof. But he shines here and he plays the villain in such a way that you both feel bad for him and hate him at the same time, which is proof of a well executed villain.Otherwise, stay away from this turkey at all costs. Don't believe the positive reviews, the critics are right for once. I figured it was just the unhealthy and unfair hate-on they have for Snyder, but nope. They're right. I'm guessing WB hired plants to write reviews, because a lot of the reviews do seem very much vague. This film will ruin everything you love about Superman, so avoid at all cost.",1.0,0.2553191489361702,1,7,0.0,neutral,-0.975,very negative,2013,10,27

But alas, the only funny part of this movie was unintentional humor, particularly the &quot;dramatic&quot; sequence at the end, with a biplane pilot flying precious &quot;serum&quot; (on New Year's Eve, apparently) over the Rockies in a blinding blizzard (some wing spars on that plane!) and eventually bailing out somewhere over the Susquehannah (some fuel tanks that biplane had!) while newspaper headlines track his progress - all in one night? As a (former USAF) pilot, I laughed myself out of my seat throughout THIS sequence - it is totally ludicrous.This &quot;weepie&quot;, made in 1939, is infinitely dated. It looks much like a prototype for &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot;, and maybe film buffs can check it out bearing *that* in mind, but if you are expecting ANY sort of humor, forget it. Stewart lurches from one setback to another, while his wife stays home with the baby and the mother-in-law (and the maid - don't forget the maid....). Trying to think of a single &quot;funny&quot; scene, I suppose the two seconds Stewart spends poking a bottle at the baby could bring a smile, but the scene where he comes home completely drunk is like watching a train wreck.As another reviewer wrote, the DVD transfer is awful. The sound seems to come from the bottom of a 55-gallon drum stuffed with cotton - turning the volume up only gets you an earful of hiss and crackle.

Watch the original series (or my personal fave 1991 series on Hulu or YouTube) to get a glimpse of what Dark Shadows really is.  It's dark, it's atmospheric, moody, gothic, romantic, soapy. Twilight, True Blood, Vampire Diaries all owe a debt to Dark Shadows.  I hope one day someone will bring it back to the small screen as that's where it should be.

Unfortunately, ""The Bachelor,"" directed by Gary Sinyor, is not one of them.  Beginning with the  voice-over narration of star Chris O'Donnell, which draws an inane analogy  between young, single, American males and wild mustangs, and on through the  rest of the contrivances of the lame story, right to the end, this movie is  a disaster.  Right out of the gate, it breaks the first rule of successful  comedy:  Play it straight, and they will laugh.  O'Donnell reads the  narrative in a lilting, sing-song manner that plays down to the audience;  it implies, ""This is funny, you can laugh now.""  Never mind that it isn't  funny, that there's nothing at all in what he's saying that makes you want  to laugh.  The intent, I believe, with this movie, was to make a romantic  comedy; what they ended up with is the most unromantic drivel you can  possibly imagine.  When Jimmie Shannon (O'Donnell) asks his girlfriend of  three years, Anne (Renee Zellweger), to marry him, she turns him down  because his proposal is so crass; the worst ever made.  Ironically, it  comes in one of the worst scenes possibly ever filmed.  Watching it takes  you out of the story and almost makes you embarrassed for the actors.  The  next day, Jimmie's grandfather (Peter Ustinov) dies and leaves him over one  hundred million dollars, provided he is married by 6:05 p.m. (the time he  was born) on his thirtieth birthday, which happens to be in ""Twenty-seven  hours and change.""  Since the girl he loves has given him the gate (and  rightfully so, because this guy is a real jerk) he spends the rest of the  movie contacting old girlfriends, trying to find one who is willing to  marry him.  And for the audience, it makes for nothing more than one long,  make that LONG, endurance test.  O'Donnell brings nothing to the  character of Jimmie; he is merely boring and tiresome.  Talk about a less  than sympathetic character.  Renee Zellweger, whose career has been on a  roll since ""Jerry MaGuire"" goes into a tailspin here.  She does her best  with what she has to work with, but it's not enough.  That there's no  chemistry between Anne and Jimmie is not her fault; O'Donnell is just so  unappealing in this role, he couldn't make sparks with a flint.  The  talented supporting cast, which includes Hal Holbrook (O'Dell), Ed Asner  (Gluckman), James Cromwell (Priest), Artie Lange (Marco) and Marley Shelton  (Natalie) is wasted here, as well.  Mariah Carey makes a brief,  inauspicious appearance as one of Jimmie's former girlfriends, Ilana, in a  scene better for all concerned had it wound up on the cutting room floor.  The single high point (if you can call it that) amid all of this dreck, is  the scene in which Brooke Shields turns in a notable performance as  Buckley, another of Jimmie's girlfriends.  She plays her with an aloofness  that actually makes her endearing; and to find that in the midst of this  film is a minor triumph.  To put it as succinctly as possible, this is a  bad movie.  There's not a laugh to be had, and even the attempted slapstick  and sight gags fall short, which proves that nothing can save a project  that begins with a screenplay as acerbic and obtuse as this one.  Personally, I refuse to walk out on even the worst movies, or to even turn  off a video without sticking it out to the bitter end; it's like a code I  live by.  With this film, though, I must confess, I honestly came as close  as I ever have to breaking my own rule.",1.0,0.75,5,1,-0.3182,negative,0.9718,very positive,2000,6,8

Oh, my.&#8221; On the other hand, worth noting: the IMDB trivia page for Gallowwalkers notes that the project was originally a Japanese offering starring Yun-fat Chow; one wonders if the disappointed fanboys, myself included, would be singing the movie's praises had it stayed that way. But thinking too far down those lines, well, that way lies madness (or, worse, a desire to bankroll something like the abomination that was Priest); we got what we got, and what we got is a ridiculous, shameless, incoherent dog's dinner of a film that makes me wonder why I am even seeing a headline in the &#8220;related news&#8221; section that says Gallowwalkers sells wide. Having now seen the wretched thing, but not having clicked to read the article, I can't help but wonder if the person who bought wide still has a job at VMI Worldwide. (Well, as of this writing, the movie has yet to open in Peru, so maybe it won't be a total loss.)Aman (see what they did there?) (Blade's Wesley Snipes) is a cursed gunslinger in an alternate-universe American west. We find out early on he's after a gang of outlaws for some reason or other (the &#8220;some reason&#8221; becomes a mildly important plot point, therefore it's a spoiler). He keeps finding lackeys, but he's really looking for the gang's leader, Kansa (The Last Horror Movie's Kevin Howarth). Problem is, the gang are all undead. As such things happen (at least in the movies), Aman reluctantly acquires himself a sidekick in the form of Fabulos (Radio's Riley Smith), an eager young gunslinger who's just looking for some action. Well, he gets it. The end result feels like it was supposed to play out kind of like Django meets Blade......but instead it feels a lot more like Lust in the Dust meets Blade II (and I know there are some people who have some love for Blade II, and, well, I'm sorry for you). There was a great deal of talk back in the day about how this was going to be Wesley Snipes' comeback film. Now, I'm a Wesley Snipes fan from way back, and as a result I've seen a few of the films he's done since fading from the public eye, tripe like The Art of War and Liberty Stands Still and (ugh) Game of Death...and I'm here to tell you that every one of those movies is acres better than Gallowwalkers. This is just terrifying, but not in the sense that the movie is scary&#8212;it's a movie where it seems everything about it was simply the wrong decision. I mean, you make a movie where Yun-fat Chow was originally attached, Wesley Snipes stepped into the role, and there are no martial arts sequences whatsoever. How does that even happen?  And, okay, maybe I'm reading in the Blade-series similarities because of Snipes' involvement, but I don't think that's 100% of what I'm seeing here; Goth and Reay (who were responsible for the 2005 snoozer Cold and Dark previous to this) weren't wearing that particular heart too far away from their sleeves, to the point of giving Howarth a long blond wig (spike that thing out and with the mannerisms his character adopts, he might as well be Stephen Dorff). Now, I am willing to entertain the idea that when Goth and Reay put together the first draft of their script, it might well have been comprehensible. Maybe even good. Interesting characters who did interesting things and didn't simply exist in between action sequences (in other words, more Unforgiven&#8212;another movie this borrows from liberally&#8212;instead of [fill in the Michael Bay movie here]). If that is the case, all the good stuff got &#8220;fixed&#8221; in post.Only for the hardest of hardcore Wesley Snipes fanatics.

Shaft's co-writer made Wonder Woman into a blond wearing a cheesy jumper. It's theorized he also was influenced by Mike Sekowsky's direction of Wonder Woman comics.  Character names are the only thing which appears recognizable. Whoever was in charge of casting honestly did not understand that even in Sekowsky's 'mod era' Wonder Woman still had her dark hair. This is is a complete mess!Opening music sounds like a dental drill, and not at all exciting for a good movie. Or even good plot. Here is the viewing audience's warning of what we are in for. And what on earth is the purpose of placing her in a trap with rainbow-colored mud? She plays some kind of secret agent, rather than a superhero who goes under cover as a mortal or even a Wonder Woman who has lost her powers. It's not clear what angle the script writers were really attempting to create.Kas Garas looks bored instead of in need of rescue/assistance as Government Agent Steve Trevor. Apparently pitying his involvement with this project, people later in charge of the 'good Wonder Woman' did give him a guest role as 'Lucas' during an episode. His talent really shines through with halfway decent scripting efforts.I am assuming that then-tennis star Crosby only obtained her title role because the studio wanted an 'athlete' to play the Amazing Amazon. It was a really stupid move. Crosby actually 'bested' Lynda Carter--who obviously was built for the part. Crosby would have been better as one of the 'background' amazons who also lives on  Paradise Island. Or 'a woman in America'.  And I'm sure a few people in Hollywood lost their jobs when this TV movie failed to rake in the anticipated 'super' big bucks just for having the 'Wonder Woman' name slapped onto something.Realizing they were being fed 'imitation' people were not impressed. Fortunately, since this was the era when there were only 3 networks--and no cable, the idea of Wonder Woman as a TV series was not immediately pulled from television production. It went onto a 'second life'.Maybe this movie and it's failure was a blessing in disguise. Carter got to work with the 'new' and severely retooled high dollar project, while Crosby's name is forever attached to this train wreck of a script. Of course she  wants to pretend she was moving on up and away to the ABC series. The movie is garbage.Thank goodness this TV movie aired when there were only three networks and much less ratings pressure than today's world.

Unfortunately the plot is so weird.It moves back and forth between two centuries to show how Laura (Caitlin McIntosh) ended up being some kind of super-powered non-vampire (in that she doesn't have fangs and can run around in daylight). She runs around searching for the 'old town' and there's a strange sub-plot where she lost a tooth back in the previous century and how Lazarus (Carlos Antonio Le&oacute;n) the vampire who turned her buys it from a modern-day goth.She is chased, or rather tracked by Julian (Jason Contini) who has something akin to a modern Ouiji Board with a crystal pendant that swings out to point in which direction she has taken.Finally they confront each other after more than an hour of next to no vampirisim and she develops a double set of fangs (two upper, two lower) and bites him and suddenly she seems to be more evil then before.She finds her missing tooth (missing a few centuries) and puts it back in her mouth.And this is why the film is so dumb. Most of it is spent by her being chased. She's not a vampire in the chase 'cause she can go out in daylight, and eat regular food, but she has some kind of super-speed, and super-strength. Yet when she was chased and caught and staked 100 years ago she was easily captured by some local villagers. Now, in the present she's being chased by a guy with some supernatural tracking device, as well as scores of police, including elite SWAT unit personnel, and she can defeat them all.If you want a film where a girl is chased by cops for about half a film, then this is the ideal film for you.Caitlin McIntosh has a nice set, but they're only seen in near profile, only once.

However, I always wanted to see the other ones. Last night I finally saw the oldest of the 3, and was aghast. I could not  believe all the liberties taken with Jane Austen's masterpiece. New  characters were added, scenes changed -- which so far is not that bad,  considering the time constraints. What really horrified me was the complete  change in personalities of the main characters. Darcy is not supposed to  openly admire Lizzy until after her rejection -- until then he is supposed  to be struggling with himself, trying to control his feelings until he  cannot hold them any longer. Laurence Olivier was definitely not  indifferent to Greer Garson's Elizabeth -- his performance was much more  subtle and nuanced (definitely superior in every aspect) playing Max de  Winter in Rebecca (a wonderful movie), which oddly enough was released in  the same year as this production of P&amp;P. It just confirmed my  long-standing belief that no one can play Mr. Darcy better than Colin  Firth. Greer Garson looked too old to play Lizzy -- but that's beside the  point. She lacked the playfulness that Jennifer Ehle was able to bring to  the character. Garson by comparison was very stiff. But what really shocked  me was Lady Catherine. According to the book, until the end she is supposed  to oppose Darcy's marriage to Lizzy, and here she not only admires  Elizabeth, but helped Darcy in obtaining Lizzy's acceptance of his  proposal! These are absolutely NOT minor details. These changes touch the  core of the book, and that, in my opinion, is inadmissible.Jane Austen's  Pride and Prejudice is not an openly funny book -- it makes you laugh by  being witty (two very different things). This production of P&amp;P somehow  found the need to add comedy relief, such as the parrot and music box scene  when Lady Catherine goes to Longbourn. Another reason why I love Jane  Austen so much is that all her novels have a happy ending. But for this  movie that was not enough. They had to end it with introducing a love  interest for Mary (who is supposed to end up alone with her parents) and  match Denny with Kitty. Adding all this up, it was actually painful to  watch. But I finally gave up when Lydia called Whickham  &quot;Whicky&quot;... Puh-lease! This is definitely a travesty of a movie,  unworthy of such a wonderful novel. I was just glad I saw it on public  television -- otherwise I would have asked for my money back!",1.0,0.5925925925925926,1,1,-0.6114,very negative,0.9927,very positive,2000,5,21

660833,B00005K3OT,A1B3HGBE9GAI08,40,79,2001-09-10,Nonsensical liberal fantasy run amok,"Chocolat is awful. Juliette Binoche stars in the film (which gives her next to nothing to do), which is sort of ""Where the Heart Is..."" meets ""The Full Monty."" It's a completely offensive liberal fantasy.  The basic plot is that a woman comes to a small town in 50's France, and through the power of her chocolate making, changes their outlook on lives.  The problem with this is that you need to share its viewpoint, which is that all of the townspeople are stupid &amp; blindly follow their way of life &amp; religion since they don't know any better.The film treats Catholicism as folly. I'm not Catholic, but I was still offended. It takes place during Lent. Binoche's character tempts all of the characters to break their Lenten vows with her chocolate, and this is seen as a good thing. She doesn't attend church &amp; seems to callously brush aside their views on religion. Basically her character's goal comes at the cost of the town's way of life, and we're expected to applaud that.  I just want to warn you that the film, while seemingly sweet, is incredibly subversive in the worst way. It manipulates the audience into accepting the offensive views it has, and then tries to beautify its ugly ideas with mood lighting.If you watch the film with any sort of rational mind at all, you can't help but be offended. I'm up for magic realism as much as the next person, but this film doesn't work at all. I didn't read the book, but the film is so flimsy. For example, it doesn't explain why the chocolates have the effects they do at all. There's one flashback in which Binoche explains the Indians believed cocoa beans make people lose all their inhibitions. That's well &amp; good, but I don't lose all inhibition when I eat a Hershey's bar. There is obviously something different about HER chocolate and the film does nothing to explain it.What I had a huge problem with though were its attitudes toward society. It's one of those movies that celebrates vagrants at the expense of people who are settled down in life, but then expects us to be happy when the main vagrants in the story all decide to settle down at the end. I don't mind that the film condemns the church &amp; the town's people so much as that it expects us to be happy when it betrays itself and decides these are good things.Also problematic is Judi Dench's character. She is presented as a fellow outcast from the town, but she is obviously influenced by what her daughter (the mayor's loyal assisstant) thinks of her. The film definitely wants to be subversive &amp; conformist at the same time, and you simply can't. The condescending way it treats the townspeople in and the pedestal it places Binoche &amp; Depp on both are ridiculous. The film is a total failure (though I'm sure people who don't much think about what they're watching are apt to enjoy it.)",1.0,0.5063291139240507,1,3,0.0,neutral,0.106,neutral,2001,9,10

I think Danny Glover is a perfectly able actor, but he was miscast here, although he was the only one who looked the part racially.  The female roles were somewhat better cast, but many of the actors looked uncomfortable speaking some of the dreadful dialog.LeGuin tells the Earthsea stories in a style that mimics, but not too closely, some of the great epics of the past, for instance the Odyssey and the Bible.  This gives it a timeless and mysterious quality and atmosphere.  The dialog writing of the movie makes the same mistake as many modern fantasy adaptions when it drops in lines that are in modern American vernacular, always painful to listen to in the context of something struggling to maintain a mythic quality.Had it not been an adaptation of the wonderful books, I would have found it somewhat interesting, but too long.

One can only hope that they simply had too much faith in the director and honestly believed that he would make a good movie. And even then, the script would have sent most serious actors on the run.First of all the plot is unbelieveably poorly conceived. Even if you accept the concept of a shark having a vendetta against a particular family, the story is so full of holes and illogical twists that you end up sitting in front of the sceen in utter disbelief: Ellen Brody has flasbacks to incidents where she wasn't present?! The pilot Hoagy actually chrashes his plain into the ocean to rescue Ellen (this is laugh-out-loud-funny if you actually consider how ridicules it is), and subsequently survives being trapped inside the plane while the shark is attacking him, then swims to the boat in prestine condition?!Jake somehow survives being dragged into the ocean, lodged between the shark's teeth, with massive bite wounds and blood loss?! What?...it just let him go? Oh, I forget, the REAL target is still Ellen Brody, who feels she has to sacrifice herself in order to stop the killings. The shark then tries to kill her by leaping unto the boat (much as in the original JAWS) but not until it has managed to stand still in the water raised on its tail long enough for Ellen to ram into it, with so much speed that it actually BLOWS up.Need I say more? But it doesn't end here. The plot is completely horrendous. Then the least you could hope for is that the action scenes were somewhat well executed. But no, not even that is the director able to pull off. First of all the shark looks entirely fake, making it impossible to have proper footage of it, rendering many of the scenes ineffective. On top of that the scenes are so poorly constructed that no suspense or real ""action"" is gained from them. The camera angles are flat and unfocused, the editing is illogical and robs the sequences of any natural narrative flow.In the end you have to be a really, really, REALLY big JAWS fan to enjoy this film, and even then I find it hard to justify actually liking it. The original was a masterpiece of action and suspense, the second one was pretty good, the third was a bit embarassing - but this last chapter (so far) of the JAWS saga is so bad I think most people just want to forget it ever happened.",1.0,0.8333333333333334,1,3,-0.807,very negative,0.8602,very positive,2002,10,4

891357,B0007US7E4,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,2,2,2008-11-28,Hell Needs Help,"""This place has nothing to do with the box,"" says Hellraiser enthusiast, Chelsea (Katheryn Winnick).  The young blonde is referring to a strange Hellraiser party that she and her friends were invited to after solving an online version of the Lament Configuration (the Hellraiser puzzle box).  Have I said the word ""Hellraiser"" enough times?  Let me say it again: Hellraiser.I'm sorry.  I'm repeating myself because I really wanted to watch a Hellraiser film, and just as Chelsea observes, this thing isn't even close.  The movie and the party it's about are cheap, showy, and barely convincing.  And, let me hammer it home, they have little to nothing to do with the franchise that Clive Barker made a name setting up.But I'm pragmatic, and I'm not some kind of Hellraiser junkie.  I can enjoy a movie on its own terms, if that's what it deserves.  So, ignoring for the moment that this pretty much bankrupts a once promising premise, if this isn't really about Hellraiser, what IS it about?Five friends who ARE Hellraiser junkies find themselves gathered at the funeral of a sixth, who apparently took the mythos too seriously, ending his life in a fit of role playing passion.  Two years later, the five still dabble a bit (now Pinhead's box is web-based), and one day they all receive a special invitation to the aforementioned party.  Once there, bloody and boring things begin to happen.One of the five is an inconsolable fellow named Jake, who is bitter and judgemental of the other four.  He attends this erotic S&M; party, but broods from room to room, scowling and refusing to have a good time.  The other four enjoy the house and its oddities with stupid and over-acted enthusiasm.  They are the kind of people who spray themselves in the face with a stranger's antique, collector's-edition Hellraiser perfume.  Without even asking!  They say the phrase, ""It's just a game,"" around fifty or sixty times, and then they die right on cue.  The deaths are a brief but welcome change of pace, because these haunted house nuts are, of course, asking for it.They're a lively bunch, though, especially the asthmatic Derrick (Khary Payton), who mugs and camps his way from line to line.  When he's playing the online Hellword game, we mostly see his unconvincing smile and vacant, eager eyes.  What glimpses we are given of the computer game don't make it look very interesting or well-made.  That's the movie for you.  And much like a computer game you spend two years of your life mastering, at the end of it you have to ask yourself if it was really worth your time.",1.0,1.0,3,1,-0.4404,negative,0.9826,very positive,2008,11,28
329270,6302719631,AK17ELWV8SMJM,8,9,2006-09-01,NOT Jane Austen,"This production was very disappointing. I can never figure out why directors & screenwriters think they can improve on the work of literary masters--they almost always come up with something more or less like this.Anyone who has read Jane Austen knows the delight of her dialogue. This version pretty much just throws it out altogether. It's more a trashing of ""Northanger Abbey"" than a dramatization.Here are some of the ways in which it fails:- It concentrates on the gothic horror aspect of the novel, which was really a secondary plot.- The REAL theme of NA is about how Catherine, naive & genuine, gains maturity by learning from her social blunders. This was essentially lost in this production.- Catherine's cute and funny personality, so strong in the book, doesn't appear here.- Henry's humor is also lost.- In fact, most of the humor is lost. (It IS a very funny book--really.)- Isabella and John Thorpe are depicted as cunning, calculating plotters. In the novel, they are opportunists, but just aren't that smart. They only succeed because the Morlands are so naive.)- Robert Hardy is made to play a ridiculous General Tilney. I resent the indignity to Robert Hardy.WHY, WHY, WHY can't the producers, directors, etc. just follow the novel and use what Jane Austen wrote? If I could understand it at age 13, don't you think most adults could?A true dramatization of the novel would be a delight. NA has the same light, bright, sparkling quality of Pride & Prejudice, and a loveable heroine both comic and nervy, for her time. It's a shame that there is nothing out there to represent NA but this disrespectful, unenjoyable production.The only thing I can praise about it is the fact that the story and costumes are set in the 1790s, when Jane Austen originally wrote its ur version, ""Susan"". There are several subtle points in the novel that make more sense in the context of 1790s Bath.(Please, BBC, do another version of this great novel, and do it more like the 1985 ""Mansfield Park"", where most of the language was Miss Austen's own.)",1.0,0.8888888888888888,1,1,0.0,neutral,0.9956,very positive,2006,9,1
233355,6300268993,AQ4X6KFXTVKJM,3,8,2001-09-02,Superman Revisioned,"Hello everyone, I must say that I am extremely displeased with Superman II DVD.  There are several reasons.  My first reason is that it is a Dobly Surround, and not digitally remastered in Dobly Digital.  Who would want to hear the opening credits and Superman II score, which was adapted from John Williams, and composed by some other guy for this movie??  That leads into my 2nd reason for not purchasing this DVD.  Missing from Superman 2 are John Williams and Richard Donner.  For Superman II, Richard Donner was replaced with Richard Lester.  Everyone knows that Richard Lester is a very, very acomplished director.  After all, his claim to fame is the Beatles' A Hard Day's Night.  Granted, the better scenes in this movie were directed by Donner, basically, every scene with Gene Hackman was part of Donner's vision.  THe scene in Houston was Lester's vision.  According to Lester's vision, it is apparant that Texans talk with an English accent.  The scenes directed by Lester and plain silly, and hurt the film.  In the first film, Superman can catch a speeding bullet, and why not??  Stuff like that makes him super, but in II, he trips over a carpet and lands in fire, in turn, that's how Lois finds out he is Superman.  So Lester wants me to believe that the perfect man has now become a clutz.  Yea right.  In Donner's orginal vision, Lois Lane put Clark Kent to a test to find out if he is Superman.  She pulls out a gun and shoots him (this can be scene in the bonus material in Superman DVD).  Now that is more believable.  Rumors have been circulating around the web, and hopefully they are true,but the rumor is that Richard Donner and Warner Bros (AOL-Time Warner), are gonna dig into their movie collection and pull out the original Superman II film, and make a brand new Superman II movie.  This version will be known as Richard Donner's Superman II, where the script is not campy, there is no forced humor, and the movie stays honest to the audience.  Gone will be the opeing sequence in Paris, the silly Niagra Falls will be replaced with the original Niagra Falls vision.  As a big Superman fan, I would hope that when Richard Donner creates his Superman II, that he will bring John Williams in to rescore the movie.  Now, the one problem is that Richard Donner filmed only 70% of the Superman II.  The Houston and Battle over Metropolis was filmed by Lester.  I'm assuming (and hoping) that Donner will reshoot parts of those scenes, and splice them into the movie, and remove some silliness.  I'm hoping the army is removed, and reshot.  With the computer capabilities in this day and age, I couldn't see how Donner couldn't tailor the scene to the way he wanted it, or at least make it close.  I'm sure everyone has scene Star Wars: Special Edition.  And I hope Donner removes the scene with Mt. Rushmore (Mr. Lester, what were you thining?).  And in the Battle of Metropolis, hopefully Donner removes the silly parts, such as the an talking on the phone, the man losing his wig, and the ice cream flying in the air.  If this rumor is turns out to be true, of Donner finally realizing his vision, then I advise everyone to save their money, and purchase Richard Donner's version.  People must remember that Richard Donner is one of three very special directors, along with Tim Burton and Brian Singer, he was able to take a comic book character and make a believable movie.  To close my review, I suggest everyone to purchase Superman, and wait until Richard DOnner's Superman II is released.  I know the only Superman II DVD that I will ever buy, will be Richard Donner's version.",1.0,0.375,1,3,0.0,neutral,0.9927,very positive,2001,9,2

But do it on your web site, or at least clearly identify yourselves. I have a HUGE problem with the lack of disclosure, that the companies funding this have a direct financial interest in pushing public opinion & policy in their direction.And the film did in fact twist some facts & conveniently omit some statistics. For example, forgetting for a moment about Fukushima, Chernobyl, & Three Mile Island... if you live close to a nuclear power plant, even one that's somehow immune from human error, computer error, or natural disasters, you are 500% more likely to develop cancer (see Gary Null's documentary Fatal Fallout, or the 1,000 books on the subject).The film basically said radiation doesn't kill people...that's kindof an insulting half truth...saying that the subsequent cancer is what actually kills you.That's like saying heart attacks aren't dangerous and nobody ever died of one...the victim ~actually~ died from from lack of blood flow to the brain, and you can't prove to me that those two things had anything to do with each other!This film started out interesting, and it's an important topic.

608121,B00005JLXE,A3U4VUSBJMR5KP,2,5,2003-08-01,"Duller Than Affleck Himself, So Why the Great Disc?","""Daredevil"" is one of the worst movies of 2003.  Despite being based on a very interesting comic character, and following one of the better story arcs in that character's universe, the movie simply fails on just about every level, except for set design and cinematography.  It wasn't even that successful at the box office, which makes this 2-Disc edition that pulls out all the stops so surprising.  FOX does a much better job with this release than Columbia did with ""Spider-Man"", which was a MUCH better film.First, the movie.  Ben Affleck plays Matt Murdoch, blind crusading lawyer by day, superhero crusader in NY's Hell's Kitchen by night.  The movie does a very good job setting up the origin story, and then collapses in it's own bloated storytelling.  See Murdoch was blinded by a freak toxic spill as a boy, which has enhanced his other four senses in such a way that he basically sees better than those with functioning eyes.  He became a lawyer to right the wrongs of the world, apparently, though he's not a prosecutor per se, which would seem ideal for a young man out to see justice done, though the first time we see Matt he appears to be prosecuting a rapist.  Why?  Maybe he moonlights at the DA's when not working at his own Law Firm.  It's a tad confusing.  He even lets up on the rapist in court specifically so he can kill the guy later.  So he's a different hero-he kills people.  (Batman was never supposed to be a killer, by the way).Anyway, one day he and his law partner are eating breakfast when Jennifer Garner walks in.  Matt smells her perfume so he knows she's a hottie, and proceeds to try and find out who she is.  Her name is Elektra, and he father is a big Corporate type.  This is important because dear old dad has ties to the Kingpin, played much too genially by Michael Clarke Duncan.  Kingpin is the source of all crime in New York, sort of like Professor Moriarty was the source of all crime in the world of Sherlock Holmes, only Matt Murdoch is no Holmes, and the Kingpin breaks people in half.  He's connected to Murdoch's past in a way that is so obvious you aren't sure if the filmmakers are trying to be clever and failing, or just being sloppy.  Anyway, Daredevil starts messing around in Kingpin's business, so he calls in Bullseye, an Irish assasin played by talentless Irish actor Colin Farrell who can hit just about any target and has a bulls-eye scar in his forehead.  Colin Farrell must have made some kind of classic deal with the devil, in which he gets to be in a lot of movies, but they all stink, as he in NOT a talented actor but the press loves him.  Anyway, Elektra gets involved through a dumb plot contrivance and becomes an assasin.  All of this leads up to...not much.  As I said before, not a whole lot really takes place in this movie.  It's trying to be about bigger things than action, like love, duty, honor, and justice.These characters do talk alot, which is a mjor mistake when you cast Affleck in the lead.  Garner displays almost none of the charm she has in ""Alias"", or even in her brief but impressive cameo in ""Catch Me If You Can"".  The makeup people have also found a way to make her look unatractive, which I would have thought impossible, but they do.  The talks between Murdoch and Elektra are poorly scipted attempts at serious romance between too hurt souls, and come off as trite.  Colin Farell hams it up enough to keep him from being too annoying.  The biggest waste is Duncan as Kingpin, who is not writen nearly menacing enough and seems more like a genial tough guy than a criminal overlord.The film was written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson, a Daredevil fan, he claims, who's only other credit is Simon Birch.  He shows very little action skill here, as even the potentially excellent set pieces he sets up in a church organ are sloppy and he uses CGI effects like a crutch.  Plus, he seems to have given Murdoch powers he never had in the comic, such as flight, or so it appears.  The film does look good and dark, stealing a page from Burton's ""Batman"", who is very similar to Daredevil in motivation, so your eyes may have a good time.  But as a movie, ""Daredevil"" is a resounding disapointment in story, acting, and executuion.The DVD itself is surprisingly excellent, with in depth looks at the creation of various aspects of the film, music videos, some comic-to-screen transfers, and a Jennifer Garner Screen test that lets you see her natural beauty in a way the filmmakers chose to hide for some unkown reason.  Anyway, X2 redeemed FOX's Comic book film hold, so wait for the big edition of that one.  This film is a dissapointment.",1.0,0.4,1,3,0.3947,positive,0.9836,very positive,2003,8,1

The last half hour has a good night scene, and a shocking act of violence, but overall it's a pretentious, stupid film.  It consists of a very ugly couple (ugly on the inside mostly) screwing, yelling, screwing, and getting brutalised.  I am a fan of existential cinema, but this isn't a good example of it.  In fact, it's an embarrassment.  It's a shame, as the director, Bruno Dumont, previous film, L'humanite, is flatout amazing.  L'humanite had gotten some reviews from people thinking it's pretentious, slow (aka boring), and stupid, but it's a very powerful film with an incredible visual style to it.  This film isn't like that at all.  I think Dumont is a great filmmaker, but this is a bad misstep.  There seems to be a lot of posers out today making ""slow, ambiguous"" films in an attempt to be arty (there have always been posers of this kind throughout history, I suppose, so for us to think that they don't exist now is arrogance on our part).

The movie ""Haunted Honeymoon"", (a horror movie turned horrIBLE movie -- and a movie I have also reviewed, here on Amazon), must take that infamous place.  But ""Esther And The King"" runs a very close second!There is no orderly beauty-contest to choose a new Queen in this movie.  No -- damsels are snatched off the streets!  Esther is here shown at her wedding....when she is captured.  Haman is not a cruel, older man, here...but a cruel younger one, (with lecherous designs on the new Queen!(  Mordechai is shown in prison, (!), and raises his chained arms in a very corny display.  But the worst thing I remember about this movie, (I saw it when it first played in the movies....and have stayed away -- FAR away -- from it ever since) -- is that the CLIMACTIC scene, wherein Esther risks her life for her people, by appearing, unbidden, before the King, NEVER TAKES PLACE!  I mean, HOW expensive could it have been, to provide a few corridors, and a very long throne room for this, one of the Old Testament's most dramatic moments?After I had first seen this movie, I was shocked -- and double-shocked.  My friends told me it was the ""Persian Version"" -- to which I replied I suspected I now knew why the Shah was deposed.This is a very, very bad, and excruciatingly corny movie.  The actors, (especially Richard Eagen and Joan Collins), do try, and try very hard, to make it work.  But with a script as bad as this, even Sir Laurence Olivier couldn't have made it involving, believable, or un-embarrassing.The much later movie, ""ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING"", (reviewed as well, by me for Amazon), is better -- but not much.  THE best re-telling of the Story of Esther, and of the Jewish holiday of Purim, is the BOOK, called ""Behold Your Queen!"", by Gladys Malvern, with illustrations by her sister, Corinne Malvern.  THIS book tells the story with depth, feeling, intelligence, and suspense!  THIS book should be made into a movie.  Get it out of the library, or save up and buy a copy here on Amazon.  The story of Esther has power, lessons, pathos, and excitement.  So does ""Behold Your Queen!""

Then, for whatever reason, the charism was taken away in the mid 80s and the man has spent the ensuing decades churning out mostly rubbish. Not only has he embarrassed himself with horrific new conceptions like ""Howard the Duck"", but he has debased the quality of his successful franchises with sequels and ""prequels"" of positively shameful inferiority. ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is the nadir of Lucas' artistic degeneration.Unbelievably stupid, boring and utterly without charm or suspense, this movie disgusts as well as insults the viewer. Figuring (correctly) that the public will pay to watch Harrison Ford pick his nose so long as the film has the ""Indiana Jones"" title attached to it, Lucas tied half his brain behind his back and produced something of truly historic worthlessness.Firstly, the inane storyline insults the viewer's intelligence. The ""pre-Columbian"" crystal skulls at the center of the plot are well known to be, in reality, 19th century European forgeries that were made to swindle gullible academics. That knowledge takes something away from the informed viewer's ability to suspend disbelief. What will be Indy's next adventure? Unlocking the secret powers of Barnum's Cardiff Giant? These action heroes like Ford and Bruce Willis also seem to get more ridiculously superhuman as they get older. I'm glad to find out that the phrase ""nuke the fridge"", referring to Indy's use of a refrigerator to survive a nuclear blast, has now replaced ""jump the shark"" to refer to TV shows and movie series that are so creatively depleted that they resort to the most moronic and implausible gimmicks to move their story along. Swinging from vines at the pace of a speeding automobile, riding rocket sleds and having anthropomorphic animals help the good guys are also great examples of the disrespect Lucas has for his audience.Whatever remnant of possible enjoyment that could have been taken from the movie was ruined by the insipid, cartoonish and completely convoluted script, the groan-inducing clich&eacute;s of 1950s culture, the smug, self-referential allusions, the irritating Shia LeBoeuf as Indy's love child, and the whole dopey idea of space (sorry- interspace) aliens sitting dormant in the middle of South America until someone returns their leader's head.I really shouldn't have written this much about this horrible film, but I am seriously outraged at how a great movie franchise was ruined by its own creator.

There are a lot of movies made these days that appeal to both kids and adults and many succeed in that.  This is NOT one of them, if that's what they were trying to accomplish.  For the most part I don't see this as appealing to kids or adults.  The ""wild"" creatures were somewhat interesting at times, but sort of a cross between frightening, freaky and comic.  There are too many problems with this movie.  Bratty kid trying to get attention runs away after biting his mother, jumps in a boat and just happens upon an island with strange creatures.

They should leave this kind of movie to the Disney people who probably could have done a much better job with the story.  Too many holes in the story.  Nothing is resolved.  The only thing I found interesting was the music, but the music didn't seem to go with the movie. There were a couple of things in the movie that I thought were totally inappropriate for children; one was when one of the creatures knocks down two owls, mid-flight with rocks.  The creature then says, ""They like it when I do that"".  She picks up the stunned owls and puts one under each arm.  Apparently they are not injured.  In another scene one creature rips the arm off another.  While it is not too gruesome, it's a stupid, unnecessary scene.  The music and the movie were both totally weird.  This is a freaky, niche movie that probably won't do very well over time.  Not recommended to anyone.  Hard to believe that some people actually thought this was a good movie.

This ridiculous gyrating camera, intended to suggest a ""gritty, cinema verite, ""you are there"" documentary"" feel, is now an established film technique, probably hatched by some MTV hack. Of course, if you are an ardent camera shaker, you must also fill your film with huge closeups of the actors' faces, to suggest gravity and deep emotion.

29148,0780619331,A16GGCDUETTTDB,5,8,2006-03-06,This movie sure is a wierd protrayal of America,"First of all, yes, this film was made in Vancouver, with only a few shots of the Manhattan skyline. When Golden Harvest was making this film, they had to try their best to shoot at angles that didn't show any mountains, and they had to paint grafitti each day and unpaint it each night. Then Jackie Chan told them to simply forget all of that and focus on the action.Well, action was what they focused on the most indeed. It sure is funny to see how the Chinese thought of the United States at this time, because what you see in this film are hippies that drive around in trucks full of beach balls. You also get multi-ethnic gangs trashing places (seriously, the gang has a Native American with pigtails and a frayed jacket! That's almost offensive). You have fat cops that just sit around smoking cigars. You have random, small-crowd rock concerts where everyone is dressed up in animal suits! Bizarre indeed.As for the actions, this film has some of his best. The first fight scene in the grocery store is supurb, and graceful, using his jacket to dispatch enemies, and endlessly hitting the same guy in the nose over and over. He takes on the entire gang in a back alley before getting cornered, very impressive. This leads to a scene where he's being chased around the streets of New York, where the entire gang, on motor cycles, try to run him over, and Jackie must rely on his ability to run like the wind and climb like a monkey. He also does a dangerous stunt where he jumps from the roof of a parking garage onto a fire escape of another building. No harness or wiresupport! The fight scene at the gang's hideout is also one his best, using whatever object he can get his hands ont, and very acrobatic. Also, Jackie Chan has to cling to a hovercraft while it drives on water and land! Some of this was done on a broken ankle!If this DVD was uncut and undubbed, and had the original score, I'd give it a total of three stars. Unfortunately, for a so-so film, New Line makes it worse. Some of the dubbing is very bad. It seems as if New Line dubbed some of the original English dialouge also. Only very, very little of the original Cantonese dialouge is there. Also, the film's original score has been redone to a more orchestrated score with slight rock. Many, many scenes were cut from the original movie. Not only that, but some of the action scenes were cut too.Try and find an uncut version out there. This DVD you should stay away from.UPDATE: The best DVD out there is Warner Brother's Japanese version. It will give you the entire film undubbed and uncut (minus the scene where Nancy and Keung escape from the nightclub and Nancy pushes over the gang's motorcycles). It has no English subtitles, but it shouldn't matter. It is nice to hear all the actors' original voices, the original score, and all of the fight scenes uncut.",1.0,0.625,1,1,0.3182,positive,0.9561,very positive,2006,3,6

Oh sure, the story is  touching and all, but this one just didn't do it for me.  Which is quite surprising since I think Dick Van  Dyke is a wonderful actor. Van Dyke plays Claude  Fitzwilliam, better known as Fitzwilly. Fitzwilly is a  butler with a giant heart. Employed by Victoria  Woodworth (played by Edith Evans), a kind elderly  lady who has managed to trick herself and the  outside world into believing that she is worth a  fortune. Trick herself? Now that's something I gotta  learn to do; then maybe I won't feel so bad next  time I spend a ton on clothes! Anyhow, Fitzwilly  and fellow servants, being the committed employees  they are, must engage in all sorts of criminal  behavior in order to keep up this charade. Can you  believe Mrs. Vicki is even giving money she doesn't  have to charity? When Mrs. Vicki hires a secretary,  Juliet Nowell (played by Barbara Feldon), Fitzwilly  must try and keep their criminal activity hidden. So  a romance ensues, as he attempts to distract Juliet  (and I would guess the writers' attempt at making  the story line a bit more interesting as well).

Well, this movie is all of that and more and I didn't like it at all.Bad Lieutenant isn't an easy movie to watch and not because of the subject matter, which was bad enough, but because it really doesn't have a plot. The story is about a police lieutenant who happens to be . . . bad. In fact, he's so bad, that if the name of the movie had been The Very Bad Lieutenant it wouldn't have been an exaggeration. The Lieutenant (he had no other name in the movie) is bad in the sense that he drinks, drugs, swears, lies, whores, gambles and pretty much anything else he wants to do without misgiving. Or does he? The Lieutenant appears to have another side to him that gave me the impression that he knew what he was doing was wrong, and that it was all contrary to everything he was taught growing up, but because he was in so deep there was nothing he could do (or wanted to do?) about it. Or maybe my impression was just me trying to make some sense of his actions. There was nothing in the movie that gave us any insight into the Lieutenant and truth be told, by the end of the movie, I didn't really care. In fact, if a 40-foot alligator would have crawled up from the sewer and started doing battle with Godzilla, I don't even that would have made me care. The only thing I cared about while watching Bad Lieutenant was the little counter on the DVD player as it worked it's way closer and closer to 90-whatever minutes. What little plot there was involved a disturbing sex crime and the Lieutenant trying to solve the crime. The Lieutenant's motive is anyone's guess because the movie offered no real insight into the character and/or how he got where he was in life. We can make some guesses, but that's about it.Harvey Keitel is very good in the movie and it's his performance alone that saves Bad Lieutenant and makes the movie worth watching, but only if you're a Harvey Keitel fan. Bad Lieutenant also had some nice scenes of New York and there was a baseball subplot that I enjoyed.I wouldn't recommend Bad Lieutenant anyone other than the absolute Harvey Keitel fan.",1.0,0.4166666666666667,1,1,-0.3412,negative,-0.9958,very negative,2011,2,14

For one, the plot bears little resemblance to the plot of the book.  The book was excellent, but its plot was not particularly adaptable into a movie, because plot is not really what the book is about in the first place.For another, the book, while not tragic, is not remotely funny or comedic, and could not have been intended to be.  The heroine's mother in the book is both charmless and damaging; her idiosyncrasies (to use too trivial a word) cause pain to those around her.  There is nothing funny about her.  Nor is there anything funny about the heroine's life, either the events that befall her in the novel or that happened before the book opened.  How anyone imagined that the book could be turned into a comedy--or even a movie with comedic moments--is beyond me.

566353,B0000541TL,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,1,1,2003-04-08,Dire,"Any attempt to follow up one of the worst of the post-Scream bunch of smirkingly ironic teen horror flicks, Urban Legend, was going to be viewed with a bit of scepticism.  Unsurprisingly, when Urban Legend: Final Cut hit the screens it bombed with most everyone that saw it.  And for good reason.  Why it even carries the title 'Urban Legend' is beyond me, as none of the murders here are based on urban legends.  Instead we've got bland lead Amy, a film college student who's in with a shot for the prestigious Hitchcock Award, which virtually guarantees a Hollywood deal.  Of course, this is a highly coveted prize and before you can shout 'red herring', there's a whole shoal of them hiding in the shadows or popping out to tell Amy to watch her back.With a truckload of references to other movies, Ottman's directorial debut (and it shows) pretends to be cleverer than it actually is, mostly by referencing more highbrow sources than others of its kind.  Unfortunately that doesn't mean it doesn't succumb to a death of boredom and deja-vu.  The deaths are unimaginative and a killer in a fencing mask is only marginally better than the parka in the prequel.  The acting is also below par, with the exception of Lorretta Devine as the surviving security guard from the original, who is consistently hilarious.  There really is nothing to recommend this movie at all actually.  It can't even be recommended as being so bad it's good - it's just plain bad.  Thankfully there appears to be returning trend towards genuine horror with the likes of The Others and The Ring, but for now it's just hard to accept that in Scream, one of the most original and influential movies in years, influenced all the wrong directors.

1600530,B009NNMAZI,A3M2WW0PO34B94,36,55,2013-08-04,"Been There, Done That Many Times Over","This summer has had some hits, but it will most likely be remembered for a string of high-profile box office bombs featuring highly-paid stars who usually deliver better films and better box-office. The string of bombs continues with ""White House Down"", the latest Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day"", ""2012"") film starring Channing Tatum as Capitol policeman John Cale and Jamie Foxx as President Sawyer.Emmerich has created an impressive number of very successful summer popcorn films; he isn't trying to make Oscar winners, he is trying to elevate the B movie to an art form. With each new film, he combines wholly improbably plots with corny acting and over-the-top special effects. And it usually works; just the type of thing to spend a couple of hours escaping the hot summer sun while enjoying big handfuls of popcorn and soda.But ""White House Down"" doesn't. And there are a number of reasons why.Some people are pointing to the March release of ""Olympus Has Fallen"", a film with a very similar narrative. Every time two different studios decide to release similar films they always end up in a pissing match. Who will be first? Who gets the prime release date? Who has the bigger stars? But ultimately, none of this matters. ""Olympus Has Fallen"" doesn't have the star power of the more recent Emmerich film. But ""Fallen"" had a lower budget and made money. The last time two studios competed, they jockeyed for position and ""Mirror, Mirror"", a terrible film starring Julia Roberts, was released first and flopped badly. A few months later, ""Snow White and the Huntsmen"", a marginally better film, made enough money to warrant a sequel. The lesson learned? Star power and release date don't matter. If ""White House Down"" were a better film, no one would remember or care about ""Olympus Has Fallen"".The key mistake in ""White House"" is that everyone takes everything so seriously. It's a preposterous story and there needs to be a certain amount of wink-wink. All of the best examples of this genre (""Die Hard"", ""Lethal Weapon"") include humor, one-liners and funny tag lines.Cale is desperate to become a member of the Secret Service and has an interview with Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaal), the newly appointed head of the President's security detail. She is replacing Walker (James Woods) who is retiring. Cale brings his daughter Emily (Joey King) to the White House, because she is a history freak and he needs to earn some Daddy points. The interview doesn't go well and Cale decides to put on a happy face for his daughter who urges him to join a tour of the White House. During this time, a group or mercenaries, led by Stenz (Jason Clarke, ""The Great Gatsby"", ""Lawless"") infiltrates the White House and begins to fire bullets, taking control. Cale realizes someone needs to protect the President and the two men quickly elude the terrorists. Little Emily, in the bathroom when the attack begins, can't be discounted and will play a role in the drama.During the course of the film, Cale will grow and become a hero. That is pretty much a given and something that should not come as a surprise to anyone. But Tatum who let's face it is pretty but not a good actor, fails to give the character anything very deep. I know we are talking about a summer popcorn film, but when the lead character seems to be following instructions, moving from one point to the other with no obvious thought behind the movements, it is difficult to get behind the hero, to feel anything for him. Tatum always seems robotic during his dramatic moments, delivering his lines in a stiff, stilted manner.Jamie Foxx is okay as President Sawyer. He has done better work in the past, but in ""White House Down"", he manages to display a little of the charisma and bravado he is known for. These qualities make him believable, as much as any character in a film like this is believable, as the Commander In Chief. He also has one or two funny lines, the only funny lines, which help make the film a little more enjoyable.As the drama continues, various government officials, led by Finnerty and Raphelson (Richard Jenkins) watch from a command center, trying to coordinate the rescue efforts and save the government. Moments on Air Force Two and surveillance video help them watch the drama unfold.But it is up to Cale to save the President, his daughter and the country.I think I was most disappointed by the lack of originality in just about every aspect of the narrative and filmmaking. It is an extremely predictable movie. Early on, you realize everything will be the opposite at the end of the film. When this realization occurs, nothing surprises you. Early on, Cale has an argument with his ex-wife (Rachel LeFevre, TV's ""Under the Dome"", ""Twilight"") because he missed Emily's school talent show. ""What did she do?"" ""Flag twirling..."" ""That's a talent?"" Every `big moment', a moment meant to deliver a lot of emotional or dramatic impact is telegraphed in a none too subtle fashion. This means that as soon as you hear this exchange about flag twirling, you know it will lead to a scene of the daughter using this very skill for a big dramatic payoff. However, even more shocking is how much of a blatant rip-off this moment is, borrowing everything practically verbatim from Michael Bay's ""The Rock"". Because it is such a blatant rip-off, any drama is robbed from the moment and it is ultimately a waste of time.As soon as Cale and President Sawyer get together, they begin to reenact various parts of ""Die Hard"". Unfortunately, the villains aren't memorable and draw attention to the actions of the heroes, giving everything a ""been there, done that"" feeling. Jason Clarke, who was on the short-lived television series ""The Chicago Code"" is working his way up the Hollywood ladder, doing supporting roles in high-profile films. He played virtually the same character in both ""The Great Gatsby"" and ""Lawless"" - an adult male with no control over his destiny who becomes a victim of others, so his role here is a bit different. But he doesn't stand out for any reason. One of his cohorts, a computer hacker played by Jimmi Simpson (TV's ""Breakout Kings"", ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"") chews up the scenery, but his purpose is never very clear.James Woods plays Walker, the former head of the President's security detail. He has an ax to grind and this propels a lot of the action in the film.Roland Emmerich has created imaginative, albeit over-the-top films, which always serve to entertain the audience. But something went wrong with ""White House Down"" it doesn't have the imagination, the power, the outlandish qualities of his other films. It is simply a forgettable film.

Chuck Norris makes incredible comedy films in much the same way Steven Seagal does! Who knew that Norris had the raw comedic skill to play his own straight man in what has to be the equivalent of a spoof movie played for serious.One thing that anybody watching this film needs to get straight is that it's really about beer. You heard me, beer ... that's right - it's all about how much beer the Ranger can drink whilst remaining completely fit in spite of it. It's all about drinking beer at the most inappropriate and unrealistic moments and letting the audience know that he's a real man because he can simply consume the stuff morning, noon and night, without the slightest consequence to his person. When does he get time to eat or train? He must be absolutely off his gourd 24/7! Let us never entertain the thought that he's drinking light beer ... or on the job for heavens sakes!Some of the greatest moments of pure hilarity come when his dog is shot in a late night raid by the drug kingpins boys ... when he finally reaches the dead doggy he kneels down and punches the dirt with his fist then caresses the doggy with the same hand. This is pure genius as it illustrates that he can be violent and yet tender at the same time. The presence of his chick in the doorway wearing nothing but his shirt only serves to punch up the sexual tension seemingly hidden in this scene and underpin that while Mcqualude may have lost his dog he's still gonna get lucky when he goes back inside. This is screen writing gold!In earlier scenes McQualude comes home to his babe who has just been languishing on the bed all day in a see through gown - we presume just waiting for the Ranger to bless her with his hairy presence. He walks in and ignores her attentions instead heading to the fridge and cracking a can of beer ... he lays on his back on the bed with that beer on his chest and gives her the strong silent treatment while she sprawls on top of him determined to see if she can get a swig. He cracks a smile at scenes end and we know right there that he's got a soft heart and will likely share a beer with her. Right on McQualude!Fast forward now where the Ranger meets up in town in an office with an Army General, an FBI guy, a Mayor, a D.A the head of the Rotary organization, general director of AMWAY etc to get the heads up on whats going down. He then heads out into the desert with the FBI dudes - Ranger in his ( get this ) nitro charged 4x4! For anybody that knows anything about 4 wheelers and or driving such I'll just let that simmer a moment as you now consider scenes where he's seen speeding along highways like a Ferrari in the same Nitro Charged vehicle much like the Batmobile would exit the Bat Cave; Super stuff indeed!So once out in the desert in his Nitro 4 Wheeler he is traveling in convoy with the Feds in their own stock standard 4x4 - what happens next is pretty gripping stuff but it's teaches the audience a lesson about McQualude. The Feds who are in front of the Ranger get stuck on a little bit of gravel about the same size as everything else they've been driving over for the last 30 mins. Amazingly to my observant eyes I could not detect the slightest sign of them being cross axel'd or hung up with their diff! But don't let this get in the way of an exercise in superiority because The Ranger turns to his young partner and says "" Let's show em what this thing can do"".McQualude does a quick maneuver and nudges them from behind and un-sticks the Feds vehicle from the pebbles they were mysteriously hung up on - to which one Fed exclaims to the other ...""What has he got there, a tank or something?"". What the writers wanted us to learn here is that the Rangers vehicle is an extension of the Ranger himself and that he is superior in an unassuming and yet strong silent way. His truck drinks Nitro and he drinks beer ... together they are man and machine perfection! We are indeed a privileged audience and ought to think ourselves even lucky to be viewing a film like this about the Ranger.After those intense moments in off roading we find the bad guys camp in the desert headed up by none other than Kung Fu's David Carradine. When the time comes at night for the Feds and McQualude to make their attack he gets shot and overcome after taking a few with him. A Helicopter lands and out gets Carradine with the Rangers chick who is also the Carradines chick ... confused? Don't be. So now they beat up on the Ranger a bit while the chick pleads for his release and Carradine decides to bury the Ranger in his Chariot like an old Viking. They chuck Norris into his Nitro machine of 4 wheeling superiority and begin to bury him, and it, alive with a huge front end loader smothering it with dirt.What happens next is the central BEER axis point of the entire film - it's when the Ranger, his Nitro machine and a can of beer all fuse together, become one and by some hidden manifestation of all that is masculine Mcgyver their way out of certain death! So we now see the Ranger inside his truck cab, dirt pouring in over the vehicle ... the Ranger is still half conscious from his licking at the hands of Carradine but he manages in his near death like state - AND with eyes closed - to reach for a can of beer. We see his can cracking finger weakly hovering over the ring and he tries to summon the strength to crack one last beer ... he finally cracks it, takes a long swig and then pours the rest over his head in a show of cryptic defiance to his wanton alcoholism! He doesn't want to get drunk just yet ... but he wants a taste and the rest, the rest is for luck!Just as the Ranger is done fusing his body with beer he reaches for the ignition, hit's the nitro super charger, digs his foot into the floor and screams in agony as he wheel spins his way out of his own burial ... the entire scene is ejaculatory as he bursts from the ground like a risen phoenix, as fluid would shoot from a freshly cracked can of beer! He kicks the door open and manages to blow a bad guy away while his partner takes care of the last few. When all are dead he rolls out of the truck cab a spent force and looks to all as though dead. His partner comes over and says ""Don't die on me now Ranger"" ... it's kind of like the dead doggy scene in reverse now ... but then just as we think McQualude might be a goner ... he looks up and says ...""GET ME A BEER KID!""This really should have been the end of the film right there ... the writers missed a golden op but it goes on for a while yet through more action sequences replete with comedic timing to end with the anti climactic showdown between Carradine and the Ranger. I won't spoil the ending but suffice it to say it's not as complex as you're likely to believe at this late stage. Does he get his daughter back?

And ever since then they've just failed over and over again. I saw this movie in the theater last night with two other people and about 30 minutes in, the ENTIRE theater had just given up on the movie. Everyone was laughing at the parts that were supposed to be scary, everyone was criticizing how stupid the plot was and how dumb the characters were being.If you're looking for a scary movie, DO NOT watch this. The only scary parts in this movie are jump scares and those get boring really fast.***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***So let me get this straight, a guy who is planning to propose to a girl is asked by his brother, ""Hey instead of going to propose to the woman you want to marry, wanna go to site of the greatest nuclear disaster in history that's also still radioactive with a tour guide I met on the internet?"" And the guy agrees to this?Plus they tell NO ONE where they are going, the military tells them to turn back because it's dangerous, but they still wanna go in anyways?On top of that I would really like for Hollywood to stop using radiation as a plot device that can just do anything the movie needs it to? Radiation can apparently mutate fish into killer monster piranha, turn people into monsters, give them night vision and make them immune to further radiation poisoning? Sure, let's just throw all we know about radiation right out the window because the plot says so.Another thing that's stupid is that their van breaks down and they have to spend the night in Chernobyl. We know whatever is there doesn't like sunlight, so they're active at night. They hear something outside and it turns into an episode of Scooby-Doo. ""Hey, what was that noise outside? Let's split up gang!"" Seriously, they were almost attacked by a bear, they KNOW it's dangerous outside, why not just stay inside your van where you have some semblance of protection. Then as soon as the sun peaks over the horizon, you start walking. They stated it's 20 kilometers to the nearest guard station, you could walk that before it gets dark again. I mean, you would live if you did that. Then again I guess that would make too much sense.Also I want you to think about this, if you were in a dangerous area, there are things outside that want to kill you, your significant other has had his leg mauled, and you might not live throughout the night, would you really turn on your cell phone camera to record the two of you chit-chatting? Seriously what are you going to do with that footage? Upload it to Facebook or YouTube? Then again I guess that wouldn't help to advance the plot.Another thing, I don't care how many of these radiation poisoned guys you get together, you're not going to have enough strength to knock a 2 ton van over and move it roughly a block and a half.What's worse is that you never really SEE the monsters. This worked for Cloverfield, you never see the monster clearly until the last 5 minutes of the movie, so there's a pay off. In this movie you just see flashes of things that look human with some discolored patches on their skin. I was staring at the screen squinting and at the end of the movie I was scratching my head and thinking, ""what the hell did I just watch?""Okay one last thing and I'll wrap this up. Two of the characters end up near reactor number 4 where the disaster happened and the radiation is the worst and the Russian military shows up and kills one of the last survivors. They take the last survivor, the brunette girl and they talk in Russian so she can't understand them. They say they can't let her go because, ""She's seen them!"" So they put her in a room with the mutated people and they eat her. Ummm... if you were going to do that all along, why didn't you just shoot her like you did the other guy? Save time and just put a 50 cent bullet in her skull and leave her inside the contaminated area and let the mutated people eat the remains.***END SPOILERS*** ***END SPOILERS*** ***END SPOILERS***So I went hoping to get something awesome, but all I got was a remake of the Hills Have Eyes set in Russia.

838699,B0002KPIFA,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,6,7,2005-05-20,Unbearable,"It is with a heavy heart that I must issue this scathing report on the atrocity that goes by the name ""Unspeakable."" I should state that I did not go into this film expecting to dislike it. Far from it, actually. I figured that a horror film with a cast including Dennis Hopper, Dina Meyer, Jeff Fahey, and Lance Henriksen showed some promise. Hopper is a hoot, at least most of the time, so there shouldn't have been any problem there. Dina Meyer is a stunning beauty. Jeff Fahey, a sort of prince of the b-movie realm, is occasionally interesting. And Lance Henriksen needs no elaboration. Anyone remotely interested in movies has seen at least one picture with Henriksen in it, guaranteed. His career spans the cinematic bell curve, from A-list classics like ""Aliens"" to low budget crud notable only for the fact that he helped them greatly by appearing in them. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the cast roster for ""Unspeakable"" alone would likely draw in quite a few viewers. What needs to happen now, regrettably, is to replace the word ""viewers"" in that last sentence with ""suckers"" because that is exactly what you are if you spend an hour and forty odd minutes watching this sledgehammer to the crotch. ""Unspeakable,"" as noted in the title to this review, is unbearable.On the surface, the film looks like something for which any respectable horror fan could root. The picture opens somewhere on the Mexican border as a couple of gringo patrol agents spot a guy standing on a river bank puffing away on a cigarette. Suddenly, he disappears in a plume of smoke. Alarmed, the guards rev up the engine and speed away, presumably in pursuit of this enigmatic figure. The movie then shifts focus to an unfortunate wretch named Cesar (Marco Rodriguez) tooling down a back road in his pickup truck. He spots one of the aforementioned border patrol agents stumbling out of the darkness, looking all messed up and asking for help, and gives her a ride. Imagine his surprise when she falls over in the cab and her brain falls out of her head. Not surprisingly, some cops pull him over, witness the horror, and promptly arrest him for murder. In no time at all Cesar ends up on death row facing down a date with the electric chair. Enter Dr. Diana Purlow (Dina Meyer), a neurobiologist whose brain fingerprinting device allows her to capture images from people's heads. Despite essentially proving Cesar's innocence with this contraption, he goes to the chair after the governor of the state (Fahey) refuses to grant a stay of execution because he thinks doing so will endanger his chances for reelection.The picture kicks into high gear (ha!) with the arrival of Jesse Mowatt (Pavan Grover), a satanic serial killer who looks like the love child of John Stamos and Adrian Zmed. Purlow quickly becomes enamored with the murderous Mowatt and, despite the objections of foul-mouthed prison warden Earl Blakely (Hopper) and sympathetic ACLU type defense attorney Jack Pitchford (Henriksen), soon hooks up her little machine for some cerebral recordings. In between these antics, Mowatt battles lots of sleazy prison guards, puts up with Blakely's profane emanations, and exudes worms from his ears. He also has telepathic powers that allow him to take over people's minds (?), which essentially means he can cause a guard to commit suicide and force Blakely to claw his own face off. Predictably, the capper to this astonishingly jejune slice of horror involves a confrontation between Purlow and Mowatt that is so incredibly idiotic that one must see it to believe it. As the credits mercifully rolled, I asked myself what it was that I had just witnessed. I drew a blank.""Unspeakable"" fails on all cylinders. The acting is banal with the exception of Meyer. My hope that Hopper would rescue this clunker faded after hearing him spew profanity in a faux southern accent that is really beneath his abilities. Fahey barely appears, and Henriksen is on paycheck autopilot as Pitchford, reduced to strolling in the door every ten minutes or so to express his concern for Purlow's activities before disappearing just as quickly. Pavan (who also wrote the film, heaven help us) is boring and unconvincing as the evil Mowatt. Aside from the performances, the storyline makes no sense whatsoever, and the number of inconsistencies and inaccuracies boggles the mind. The execution sequences, for example, consist of one falsehood after another. An electric chair set up in a metal hut? Dozens of prison guards standing around watching the execution? Prisoners strapped in with a full head of hair? Where are the witnesses to the execution? Did anyone spend more than a minute actually researching how a real execution takes place? Apparently not. The only thing that offered a glimmer of salvation was the gore sequences--the shotgun to the head, the face clawing, and a few other nasty surprises--but they are too few in number and come far too late to salvage this car wreck.The number of supplements offered up on the disc surprised me considering the mediocre quality of the production. We get trailers, deleted scenes, a couple of outtakes, and extended gore sequences. How a movie like this receives this many extras when a film like ""Ordinary People"" has nothing but a trailer is a question for the ages. Anyway, there's absolutely no way I can recommend ""Unspeakable"" and continue to sleep at night. It's a muddled, ham-fisted disaster that should spend more time in the trashcan than on a video store shelf.

And while I enjoyed it at the time, this morning I woke up with a negative perspective.First, I agree with other critics about the stereotyping of races. It is a deep flaw in the film.Second, notice how sleazy the protagonists are. Bullock and McConaughey have an affair and then he gets back his wife with no repercussions at all. No moral dilemma or price to pay.Third, Bullock is a shallow smart-alecky character impossible to empathize with. The trial for her is just an intellectual game.Fourth, the depiction of whites is deplorably degrading. I noticed a very interesting thing that the screenwriter is Akiva Goldsman, who I believe is an Orthodox Jew and ardent Zionist.Goldsman also wrote the screenplay for that travesty of historical distortion Da Vince Code. And note how the anti-Christian themes in this film are really played up, especially the prominent Christian symbolism of the Klan and the greed and dishonesty of the black pastor.Now imagine transplanting this film to Goldsman's beloved and sacrosanct Israel, where Samuel Jackson is a Palestinian farmer whose daughter has been raped by Israeli soldiers or crushed to death when they bulldoze his home. Then he decides to go out and kill the soldiers or blow up an army base in revenge. Such a story would be brutally repressed in Israel.

883719,B0007NFLO0,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,1,4,2013-04-29,Less Than Zero,"""Less than Zero"" was a film that released more than 25 years ago.  It was a film that eerily mirrored the life of Robert Downey Jr., although I believe that Mr. Downey's real life turned around, while the Julian character that he played so well in that underrated film did not.  Well, luckily for us, art doesn't always imitate life.And art is obliterated here in ""Suspect Zero,"" a film that falls into a Black Hole, just like Julian and Mr. Downey did at one time.  But this film goes over the Event Horizon, while Mr. Downey luckily did not.  And this film breaks apart into a million pieces, and those million pieces of tiny particles become ultimately indecipherable.I took a peek on ""Rotten Tomatoes,"" and I was surprised to see that something like 18 percent of critics liked this film.  ""How is that possible?"" I thought.  ""It should have been so much lower than that.""  But how is this movie bad?  Well, let me count the ways, at least some of them.1.  I didn't just bring up the Black Hole thing willy nilly.  There is a guy in a psycho ward, I think, that at one point asks to Aaron Eckart, ""Do you know what a Black Hole is?""  Mr. Eckart doesn't seem to know, but the answer seemed to be insufficient.  Why not talk about Event Horizons; how the gravitational pull is incredibly strong; how things get pulled in, pulled apart, and then eventually obliterated; etc. etc.  I think that it was a nice metaphor for the killer but it wasn't explored.2.  The script.  Yikes.  At one point, Ben Kingsly looks at Mr. Eckart and says, ""I'm a confused old man.""  Well, I would agree, but only in the sense that Mr. Kingsly, who is a really fine actor -- catch him in ""You Kill Me"" which is a very fine dark comedic film, unlike this garbled mess -- must have been temporarily confused when he read the script and STILL decided to do this film.3.  Love interest.  Carrie Ann Moss is in this film, evidently an ex-wife of Mr. Eckart(?)  When I was in college taking a drama class, I remember a moment when the professor asked the class, ""What does every movie need?""  I was surprised -- and disheartened -- when overwhelmingly most people answered, ""Love Interest!""  Wrong!  You don't always need one (although Americans think mistakenly that you do in film) and she serves absolutely no purpose here.  As a matter of fact, I believe that she gets in the way.I could go on and on and on, but I try to limit my reviews to usually five paragraphs.  I could surely complain forever about this huge misfire.  But don't be like Julian and fall into this Black Hole of a mess.  If you won't listen to me, then listen to those other 82 percent of the critics who panned this atom crusher.  And when I gave this film a 1 star, I meant to add a ""-"" before it.  Because this film really is ""Less than Zero.""",1.0,0.25,1,2,0.0,neutral,-0.9564,very negative,2013,4,29

183219,156219464X,A2QZJAAPG0Q0XR,64,302,2006-04-09,Sad movie - and I mean the continuing Japanese denial of WWII atrocities,"[...]Taken just by itself, the movie is beautifully done in the way it reveals the horror and sadness of war, depicting the terrible effects on two innocent young children.  It will indeed make you cry.  I cried when I first saw it.But here's the big problem, in a nutshell.  This movie is also part and parcel of a continuing culture of denial and coverup by the Japanese about their war atrocities both before and during World War II.  The Japanese, completely unlike the Germans, were never made to fully repay their moral debt to the world, and were never made to fully apologize and atone for or even to admit their atrocities.And so to this day, the Japanese memory of their role in WWII is reflected only in movies such as this one - that the only thing of importance that happened in WWII was that the Japanese  suffered terribly, and that therefore, all war is terrible, and by association, all nations who wage war are terrible (and that of course includes the Americans, who are the only ones depicted killing people here in this movie).China and Korea to this day maintain as part of their national cultures this intense anger at these now 60+ year old Japanese atrocities.  But why shouldn't they?  Japan, like Turkey with the Armenians, has never fully admitted or apologized for the crimes committed against those peoples.  The Prime Minister of Japan continues to honor the few hanged war criminals of Japan by annually visiting their graves (it was part of his campaign promise to the right wing nationalists of Japan, who are indeed on the rise).  I say ""few"" hanged war criminals, because Japan was not fully occupied for months after surrender, and so the war criminals had time to destroy almost all of the incriminating documents and evidence.  Only the biggest names of the Japanese war criminals were ever tried, with almost all of the middle level and small fry escaping.  The onset of the Korean War, and the American need to turn Japan into a reliable ally put a final stop to further pursuit of Japanese war criminals.The level of ignorance exhibited about this continuing controversy by both the current generation of Japanese and the many Americans and Europeans who have posted in these five star reviews for this movie is just appalling.Let me just give you a frame of reference here  - suppose the Germans were to make a deeply sympathetic, sad, and beautiful cartoon movie, depicting the children of Nazi SS stormtroopers, or the children of Nazi concentration camp guards, one day playing happily in their home, and then getting horribly incinerated in a firebombing (e.g., at Hamburg, done by the British, by the way).  Can you just imagine the howling, the international protests?  Neither the Israelis and Russians, who both have much longer memories than Americans, would ever permit such a movie to be released.For all of you who were born yesterday (the five star reviewers of this movie) here's a very brief reading list:1. Rape of Nanking - Many Japanese still deny that this ever happened.2. Flyboys - the future President Bush almost ends up as teriyaki steak for cannibal Japanese soldiers during WWII.3. Superfortress - Curtis LeMay explains why he firebombed Japan.  The bottom line was that the fanatic military elite governing Japan was willing to sacrifice the entire civilian population if need be, in an American invasion.  LeMay figured that the only way to avoid this was to severely beat these fanatics into submission, and he figured that the sooner this happened, the fewer total numbers of dead people there would be.  The firebombing and atomic bombing in his estimation, saved more lives in the end.4. The White Rose - written by the sister of Sophie Scholl, a 21-year old German student who was executed for opposing Hitler and the Nazis.  There's also a movie by this name, made in Germany.In Germany today, there are many plaques honoring Sophie Scholl, and she is considered a national heroine.  Were there any Japanese who dared to stand up to the military fanatics during WWII?  Where are the plaques honoring those people?  Where are the Japanese writers and moviemakers who speak out against the evil of the military elite that governed Japan during WWII?The truth is that the very few Japanese who do dare speak out today come under intense criticism (and sometimes physical attacks) by the right wing nationalists of Japan.  The Japanese Prime Minister continues to honor the hanged war criminals.  And movies like ""Graveyard of the Fireflies"", as sad and true and beautiful as they are, are the only part of the history of WWII that the Japanese ever learn about, perpetuating the Japanese  view of themselves as co-equal victims of war, rather than as the instigators and perpetrators of war atrocities.The Germans were forced to fully come to terms with their past long ago, and have become much the better for it.

This hybrid ""in camera"", traditional feature film had nothing to do with any diary at all.  Like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and many other found footage films, they're supposed to act as a ""diary"" of events to temp us with what did or did not happen...here, in CHERNOBYL DIARIES, nothing.  We saw what happened and then we saw what didn't happen.  People disappear into the night with screams, cries and gunfire and we only learn about what may have truly happened from handheld camera phones that are so well directed and edited as to make them look like a horror film...wait, this was supposed to be a horror film.I'm not sure exactly what was the idea here, much less the point of this film - it seems like they gave the writer/director some cash and told him to work his usual magic, but make it a real movie too, so he ended up trying to fuse together two styles into one and neither sit well with the other (imagine Ridley Scott being told he had to do one, final, last edit of BLADE RUNNER and he had to use his ""final cut"" and the original theatrical release in the same movie - jarring).  The cast is bland, their performances feel purely weekend theater workshop (every emotion is played HUGE and when it's time to confront some real feelings they smother it with foul language).  The film has no hero, no heronine, the monsters we know right from the start and their actions so well-trodden that their path is very clear.  The body count feels like you're losing people to a boring party than any true horror.  For a moment I thought we were going to get a PROPHECY (1979) reboot and the monsters would turn out to be mutant bears - I was misled here with all the comments repeated early in the film about ""nature having taken over""; I thought for sure if it wasn't mutant animals then it might be hostile weeds...which would have been better than just a mutant goon squad.  The film wants to be a commentary, it wants to be a horror film, it wants to a hand held, found footage film, it wants to be SCOOBY DOO in THE WORST WAY (seriously, when everyone was trapped in the Russian MYSTERY MACHINE I could not stop laughing), but it ends up being none of these things.The city does have some effective creepy corners to explore, but overall it feels like a DLC map for HALO 4 or MEDAL OF HONOR or better yet, GOLDENEYE.  You and four buddies can do some serious damage there...but the city never truly comes alive, or truly rises from the dead to be anything more than a ""set"".  The reveal at the end as to what is happening makes no sense and smacks of lazy scripting - which, given that most directors of found footage films never have to write an actual ending makes sense here...they simply don't know what to do other than SMASH CUT TO BLACK and ROLL END CREDITS and run to the bank to cash the check.  Lots of checks were cashed in CHERNOBYL DIARIES and everyone got a credit for the resume - what we're left with is student work at worst and at best a really long public service announcement for stocking a pair flair guns in your Russian Mystery Machine (if the group only had a Velma they would have made it!) to call for help.Overall CHERNOBYL DIARIES dies long before the cast does and when it's finally over you too will feel its plan would have worked if it wasn't for those meddling kids!",1.0,0.0,2,3,0.0,neutral,0.8691,very positive,2012,11,9

Made primarily for the video market and shot on the ultra-cheap in Canada standing in for New York by the director of 2001: A Space Travesty (Bronson's salary accounted for more than half the budget and from the results it doesn't look like he was paid that much), its sole distinctions are the lowest body count in the series and in being Bronson's last theatrical feature. It feels more like a Death Wish ripoff where the producers suddenly found out they could afford Bronson and gave it a quick rewrite, with Kersey now in the witness protection programme back in New York happily engaged to Lesley Anne Down's fashion designer and bad Joan Collins impersonator. You just know how that will end up, especially since her ex-husband is Michael Sacks' mobster, who seems to be basing his performance on William Shatner impersonating Jack Nicholson in Prizzi's Honor.It's not long before Robert Joy's transvestite enforcer with dandruff is scarring her face to prevent her testifying to Saul Rubinek's DA and not that long before Bronson's much younger stunt man with different colored hair is dodging bullets and she's giving him another excuse to take the law into his own hands after taking flying lessons off the roof. A puffy Bronson is starting to look so like Oliver Hardy when he smiles you almost expect him to say ""That's another fine killing spree you've gotten me into,"" and with newspaper headlines like `Chicki Paconi killed by Canoli' it's clear that the film aspires to a more comedic approach.

It was obviously made on the cheap by people who didn't know much about horror movies but is inept in special ways. Why, for instance, does most of the movie take place in a series of poorly lit hallways? If there's a movie with more hallways in it than this one, I'm not aware of it. The movie makes a big deal about unfolding in the town of Milburn, which seems to be populated by about six people. When we do see a handful of extras, they look exactly like extras and you can sense them making an effort to be unobtrusive. Much of the movie apparently never made it to the screen; the end credits list several characters never seen. The movie, which never recovers from its awkward introductory scenes, comes to a dead halt during the campus flashback sequence, which was also the weakest, most &quot;writerly&quot; part of the book. Others reviewers here have mentioned the waste of Patricia Neal, the pained acting of Craig Wasson, and the porcelain beauty of Alice Krieg, who somehow survives the cinematographer's botch job (she outclasses the movie as a whole and has a great evil giggle to boot). To the list of complaints against the filmmakers, I'd like to add 1) the director's bizarre penchant for men in dresses (in a movie where practically nothing happens, there are not one but two such scenes); 2) editing and an overall narrative logic that rival the lunacy of &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;; and 3) the hilariously bad &quot;special effects&quot; by Albert Whitlock, which are so primitive they'd put William Castle into despair.

I greatly enjoy Singin' in the Rain and many of the Disney animated musicals, and I watched this movie expecting to like it, but I ended up hating nearly every single deceptive, ridiculous little moment.  The narrative is unsure of what it wants to be about-- initially the film focuses on Rose and her boyfriend in New York, but then it discards that story to focus on the much-less-interesting romance between Judy Garland and that completely generic Guy Next Door, and then the movie shifts *again* to the family crisis of whether the family will relocate to New York.  This is done because none of these stories are interesting enough to work on their own, but even their combined momentum doesn't amount to much.  Even worse is the film's ideology.  This is a movie that actually believes things were better back when young women forced themselves into corsets to impress the boys.  It also glorifies a bunch of people who decide to keep everything in their lives exactly the way it has always been, rather than move to a different city where they would be more successful and where they could make friends just as good as the ones they have in St. Louis.  The film helps perpetuate one of the most horrible falsehoods of our society-- the idea that change is bad and that the traditional way is always the best.  Of course, all of these complaints would be meaningless if the songs were catchy and funny and moving, but unfortunately none of the musical numbers reach escape velocity.

1102559,B000VKL6Z2,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,2,3,2008-01-04,"Evil Has A Beginning, But It's Not Worth Watching...","With the release of ""Halloween"" in 1978, director John Carpenter introduced audiences to one of cinema history's most classic villains, Michael Myers, and ushered in the era of the slasher film. Even though his film was not all that much of a slasher film, in fact it was more of a thriller, the many sequels, and countless other film series', which were spawned from it were much more in the vein of slashers. Skip forward to 2007, after 7 sequels, some good and some not so much, the `Halloween' film series seemed to have run its course, so it must have appeared to some in Hollywood that the only options left for this franchise were to, A) let it die (which would have been fine and should have happened after ""Halloween: H20""), B) continue making pointless sequel after sequel that would most likely wind up going straight to DVD shelves (case in point, the `Hellraiser' series), or C) remake/reimagine the franchise. Apparently option C seemed the most viable, as musician/director/writer Rob Zombie (""House of 1,000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"") was tapped to helm this new incarnation of Michael Myers with his remake of the original film, simply titled ""Halloween"".""Halloween"" is partly a remake of the John Carpenter original film from 1978, but is also an origin story for Michael Myers (this time played by Tyler Mane), giving viewers some insight into what caused Michael to become the monster that he is. Michael Myers seemed like a fairly normal 10-year-old kid, but appearances can often be deceiving. Behind his seemingly innocent faade was a cold-blooded killer, he just hadn't manifested himself fully yet. Then one Halloween night, Michael suddenly unleashes his dark side and kills his stepfather, older sister and her boyfriend, leaving only his mother and younger sister, Laurie alive. After the grisly murders, Michael is locked away in a psychiatric hospital where he meets his longtime doctor Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell), and begins to fall even further into the abyss of his murderous psychosis. Fast forward 15 years, and Michael suddenly decides it is time to escape the hospital that has served as his prison for so long, and return to the town where his rampage began and to finish what he started by killing his only remaining family member, his younger sister that he had spared all those years ago.The choice of Rob Zombie as director/writer for the new film didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense to me. Sure, the franchise had kind of wandered into the typical slasher subgenre of horror films, but Zombie's brand of horror was much more extreme and gratuitous than anything contained within this film series. However, when the film was released and began receiving some praise for the reinterpretation of the original classic, I thought maybe Rob Zombie had managed to make a more mainstream, and better film instead of his demented crop of horror films that he'd been crafting over the last couple of years. So, when I rented the film I approached it openly, and had hopes that it would be a good film, that could possibly equal the original (which should always be the goal for any remake), and if nothing else give an interesting origin story to the character of Michael. Upon watching the film, I soon realized, after getting about 30 minutes into the movie, that this film though not a typical Rob Zombie movie, it did contain most of the familiar elements that he loves to include in his films, i.e. plenty of language, graphic nudity, disturbing images, and extreme violence. Basically, Rob was making a more toned down film than usual, but in the end it didn't really feel like it was all that much of a `Halloween' film, as it seemed to still fit more in line with Zombie's previous two disturbing pieces of cinema, than with the series it was supposedly paying homage to while trying to breathe new life into the character.The story, as I stated earlier, is a mixture of origin tale and remake all rolled into one film. The first half of the film is devoted to the early years of Michael Myers, essentially expanding on the opening moments from the original movie. This portion of the movie was somewhat interesting because it was showcasing a different time in the life of this villain, and also giving some clues as to why he became this killer. But, this new origin seemed to contradict the opening of the original film, because here Michael's family is painted as broken and abusive, whereas in the original he appeared to have come from a loving home and he simply snapped one day. Having Michael come from such an abusive upbringing served as a way of explaining why he killed some members of his family, mainly the ones who mistreated him the most, but it also seemed like an attempt on Zombie's part to humanize Michael and to try to get the audience to feel some semblance of sympathy for the character. This is where I feel the movie made a big mistake; the film is about Michael Myers, one of the most dreaded villains in cinema, I for one do not want to be made to feel sorry for this character. Why should we as an audience be sympathetic to him, why not just show him as a kid who suddenly snapped, committed a horrible crime, and then show how he slipped further into psychosis while in the mental hospital. That is what I thought this movie was going to do, and to an extent it did, but it also seemed to go to great lengths to create sympathy, which should not have happened. Once Michael is committed to the institution the movie seems to gain momentum, and these are some of the most fascinating scenes in the movie, and I thought that Rob Zombie actually did a good job of showing the character's gradual descent into madness, and he also used this as an opportunity to explore why Michael always wears a mask, which was a surprising addition to the story.The second half of the film, is basically a rehash of the original film with some changes made to certain events, but it is pretty much the first movie condensed into one hour. This portion of the movie works on some levels, I liked some of the changes that Rob made to the original film, but it was also nice to see that even after all these years some aspects of the original movie are just too good to change, and should just be redone similar to how they were before. However, as good as parts of this section of the movie was, they were overshadowed by Rob Zombie's penchant for blood, gore, and gratuitous nudity, all of which took away from not just this portion of the film, but the entire movie as well since all of these components were sprinkled throughout.The actors in this film were all decent; those playing the various teenagers were average at best. Their performances for the most part were fairly by the book, and therefore their characters were pretty much forgettable, not a single one of them contained even an ounce of the screen presence of Jamie Lee Curtis. Her performance in the original film is part of what made that film so successful, she was so sweet and innocent, and Jamie played her so naturally that you couldn't help but invest in her as a character. But the ones here were pretty much standard horror film fare, no real standouts just a bunch of unknowns trying to make a break, but none of them deliver anything resembling a memorable performance. The highlight of the cast was Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Loomis, the role made famous by the late Donald Pleasance. Malcolm plays Loomis as a caring child psychologist who desperately wants to reach Michael in hopes of finding some good in him, and when he realizes that this can't happen it breaks his heart. So when Michael escapes, Loomis comes after him with such zeal that it seems borderline obsessive. McDowell is fun to watch as Dr. Loomis, and steals every scene that he is in, and convincingly takes the doctor from being a man who cares for this young boy as merely a patient to being a man obsessed with stopping this monster who he feels responsible for because of his failure to reach him. It was a new angle to view the character from and one that Malcolm did an exceptional job handling.In the end, ""Halloween"" is a major letdown of a remake. It fails to even come close to capturing what made the original film so good, and I think a majority of the blame must be laid on the shoulders of the film's writer/director Rob Zombie. His talents as a screenwriter and director are average at best, definitely not worthy of big screen feature films, his films seem more at home in the Direct-to-DVD marketplace. Even if you are a fan of Rob Zombie's work in movies, I believe that even you fans have got to admit that his adaptation of ""Halloween"" is nowhere near good enough to hold a candle to John Carpenter's original classic that started it all.""Halloween"" is available in rated R and unrated editions, both containing graphic violence, language, nudity/sexuality, and gore.",2.0,0.6666666666666666,4,1,-0.5717,negative,0.9826,very positive,2008,1,4
1505861,B005ZI6NHG,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,13,16,2012-04-01,Two Heads Are Better Than One,"""2-Headed Shark Attack"" is the latest ridiculous sea monster flick from The Asylum. Before you can even get to the film there's an intro from The Asylum bragging how they have done over 100 of these cheesy disaster films so far, and the beauty is that if you've seen one you pretty much know what's going to happen in any of the others: just substitute ""two-headed shark"" for ""giant alligator,"" ""enormous squid,"" or ""subterranean volcano under a metropolis"" and you've got it. As the credits unwind to obnoxious college students on a speedboat, creature feature fans may feel the hairs on the back of their neck stand up when they see the director is Christopher Douglas-Olen Ray. With B-movie genetics like this you know it's going to be an entertaining movie for all the wrong reasons. Not that I fault Chris Ray, it's not like anyone was going to make a good movie called ""2-Headed Shark Attack"" or anything. You know what you're buying when you see the title.The opening starts the production off right. Two talented water skiers in bikinis are pulled behind a boat towed by three ogling guys taking their pictures. I therefore found it a bit incredulous that nobody in the boat noticed when a giant two-headed shark leapt from the water and neatly munched them down. Not that it matters. The real meat of the story, the chum as it were, starts when we meet Professor Babbish (Charlie O'Connell) who is taking his class of insufferable students on a ""semester at sea"" to learn...well, something. It starts off with a lesson in sextant use, but quickly turns to a sunbathing demonstration. They are on a typical Florida tourist boat...no I'm sorry, a ""US education vessel,"" the ""Sea King,"" sailing ""hundreds of miles from anywhere"" and immediately sustain shark damage via a curious scene that you may not find entirely plausible. In the process the shark damages their radio antenna (ponder) and they cannot communicate with anyone. The interesting point is that bonehead jock Cole (Geoff Ward) was scolded to turn his cell phone off not more than five minutes earlier. But never mind, they are really, really stuck at sea with a crippled boat. Just take our word for it.The dialogue is predictably ridiculous (""We're not sinking. We're taking on water."") Fortunately by an amazing coincidence a deserted island is right next to them. For some reason they decide to send the Professor and students ashore to look for scrap metal to repair the boat (really?) while Mrs. Anne Babbish (Carmen Electra, who is clearly here only because of her name and sundry assets, not because of any contribution to the plot whatsoever) is in charge of vessel repairs. She has two Spanish speaking deckhands who work hard and Laura (Morgan Thompson) the lovely welder to do the work. That's a good thing, because as senior officer onboard with her ship sinking what do you think she does? Well, obviously she changes into a bikini and soaks up some rays on deck. While all that's going on, the kids are getting into petulant arguments and exploring the island, and believe me they cannot get eaten fast enough for my taste. I hope that shark is famished.If the plot isn't enough to make you laugh out loud, the acting and terrible CGI will. I have some seen some awful shark movies, but this is one of the worst on a whole bunch of levels. The effects are utterly laughable, and among the least scary of any of The Asylum movies. (That's saying something.) I truly enjoy how the entire scale of the shark varies by orders of magnitude throughout the film. Bonus points for that. The backstory unspools in an even sillier way than you would expect: voluptuous, angst-laden, uptight blonde heroine Kate (Brooke Hogan, Hulk's daughter) enrolled in the semester at sea because she was spooked by a shark in the ocean when she was 12, and hasn't been in the water since then. This is not how normal human beings make decisions. As they explore the deserted island which has well-developed roads, infrastructure, and even a church, they discover two boats which prompts the line ""Hey guys do you think these will work?"" For what? What part of ""boat"" don't they understand? What was the point of going to the island again? Never mind. Fortunately Kate is an engineering-mechanic-welding savant and fixes the boats with the help of smart guy Paul (David Gallegos,) the only remotely likeable member of the cast, while idiot Cole almost kills himself with a spear.It sure was lucky they found this island, wasn't it? Oh, but wait! The shark is making the island have earthquakes and sink into the ocean! The first earthquake injures the Professor's leg to the point he needs to be ferried back to the ""Sea King"" (why did they ever leave again?) Fortunately they forget about this as he is able to run again within two hours. Assorted mayhem occurs with much CGI thrashing and foam teeth in attendance while idiotic canned interpersonal conflicts occur in abundance. Cole steals one boat for the cool kids, leaving Kate and Paul on the other. Oddly many of the students elect to stay on the sinking island as the boats race toward the ""Sea King."" This scene will have you praying for natural selection to work its wonders. Cole comes up with an ingenious plan to jump into the water and swim for the ""Sea King"" abandoning the boat's other occupants to the shark. Sadly Kate rescues Cole and when back in shallow water explains where their relationship stands in no uncertain terms.Because this is going nowhere everyone comes ashore, abandoning the ""Sea King."" (Oh, whatever.) While Cole emotes over the loss of his party buds, the Babbish clan comes up with a brilliant plan: sink the ""Sea King."" No, seriously. You mean that boat they just left floating over there? Yes. Apparently they believe that it would be safer than staying on the visibly sinking atoll, because that would trigger its EPIRB (they don't call it that) to summon help. Turns out you don't really have to do that, but for the plot to work that's the best idea they've got. Paul (the student who should be in charge because he's the only one who knows anything about the ocean, fish, or boats) comes up with an alternate plan: fix the ""Sea King."" Brilliant! There's an elaborate subplot about distracting the shark with an electric bridge (don't ask) while the Professor sends, of all people, archenemies Cole and Kate to fix the ""Sea King."" (Suspension of disbelief is key here, people.) A favorite moment is when Professor Babbish watches the shark and yells ""It's confused!"" For a moment I thought he was talking about the plot, but nope, just the fish. Kate starts welding to fix the amusingly fake ""hull damage"" while the shark gets tired of its electroshock therapy and destroys the bridge, freeing it up to do more important things. Like eating.Cole steals the ""Sea King"" as soon as the welding is complete, leaving Kate alone in the water. You'd have thought she was imperiled what with the giant mutant shark on the loose, but no, she just wades ashore. Suffice it to say that Cole doesn't get far, and the Professor's original plan is put into action, though this is lost on the cast for some reason. As the island sinks ever lower in the water, most people run inland, but two particularly dim coeds run to stand on the smallest, spindliest dock imaginable, then precariously perch on the very edge of said dock saying ""I think we're good."" What do you, the audience, think? Do you think huge two-headed sharks can leap clean over a dock? I won't tell.Because this in an Asylum movie, there's not quite enough going on yet, so what do you think could go wrong next? Volcano? Good guess, but wrong. Enormous altruistic intervening squid? Again, good guess, but no. How about this one: tidal wave. Sadly, it's true. As it strikes the island the Babbishes have one last kiss as they are engulfed simultaneously by the rogue wave and the central character of the film. To seek refuge from the shark the remaining kids seek refuge in a church, which the shark treats as a snack basket before getting hopelessly lost inside. (It's a small church, but sharks have small brains.) Paul even gets to beat it on the snout with a crucifix. I am so not joking. The film concludes with a wholly ridiculous plan and multiple acts of bravery, and Kate and Paul finally putting us out of our misery by climbing onto the rocks of the island and waiting for the rescue helicopter which promptly shows up as the credits start to some truly awful music.The DVD has a few extras, none of them good. There is a ""Gag Reel"" which consists of a couple of minutes of assorted clowning and bloopers. It may be the single lamest blooper reel I have ever seen. Don't waste your time. There are some trailers for this and other Asylum movies, and last but least, a ""Making Of Featurette."" This documentary interviews just about everyone including the costume designer (the ""costumes"" are shorts and bikinis...really, you needed a costume designer?) It goes without saying that this is pretty boring and self-congratulatory stuff. I was amused when they interviewed Brooke Hogan, the star of the show, that there was no audio of her answers. Nice bonus feature! Don't waste your time with this one either. I will save you the time by summing up: location shooting on water is difficult.""2-Headed Shark Attack"" is just another insane monster fish debacle from our friends at The Asylum, no more and no less.

Like Gingerdead Man 2, I'm really not sure why I bothered to watch this considering I wasn't too gung-ho about the first one.  But I suppose it's folks like me as well as stoners who keep films like this in production.  I mean, somebody liked Evil Bong enough to make Charles Band make a sequel.In Evil Bong 2, the survivors of the first Evil Bong's reign of terror are suffering from exaggerated stoner side effects.  This includes constant narcolepsy, terminal horniness and overeating.  In order to find a cure, they get in contact with the hero of the first film, ""Al""(played by a different actor this time), the straight, nerdy, anti-pot guy.  They also get in contact with the delivery guy who originally delivered the bong and trace it's origins to a jungle in South America.  Our heroes go on a jungle quest to find the bong's birthplace, thinking somehow that will help them figure out a cure.  What they discover is a hot chick harvesting marijuana for medicinal purposes, a native tribe of hot women called the ""Poon Tang Tribe"", and......The King Bong.  The King Bong is the much more powerful ""boyfriend"" of the Evil Bong.To me it seems like Full Moon is only really interested in doing flat out comedies anymore, which this obviously is.  Unfortunately it's not terribly funny.  A few minor chuckles here and there, but the humor is nothing you wouldn't find in about 8,000 other stoner/raunchy/teen comedies.  I guess if you're stoned the film is hysterical, but then again, most things are.  I'm sure even Will Ferrell is funny if you're baked enough.No one even dies in the film!  At one time, Full Moon actually made attempts to make horror films.  Sure, a bunch of them fell flat and were unintentionally funny, but Full Moon is funnier and more entertaining when trying to be scary than when they are actually trying to be funny.But this film will no doubt be rented or purchased by those who liked the first one(and you know who you are!).  I actually did like the first one more because of the whole alternate universe inside the bong that was full of Full Moon characters from different films.  And as dumb as it was, it was actually horrorish, as characters were slaughtered inside the bong.  No slaughtering or anything here, just a full on stoner comedy.  You'll watch it I'm sure, but don't watch it if you aren't stoned.",2.0,0.3333333333333333,5,1,0.0,neutral,-0.4967,negative,2009,7,8

I've seen the Comet VHS tape and have also seen the ending on a movie called TERROR ON TAPE which is a compilation of horror clips. The ending gore sequence on this DVD ( the only gore scene that's shown on-screen) is noticeably shortened. This censoring of this gruesome and effective sequence damages the film. The movie itself is about a lesbian couple who encounter an alien in human form. They allow the man who appears to be injured to stay with them at there exquisite mansion that's isolated in the forest. When he transforms into the alien, only his nose, eyes and teeth change; he doesn't really look like an alien. There's some topless and rear nudity, as well as a little bit of full frontal during the violent ending sex sequence. A lesbian scene is shown, but it's dimly lit. The film has a low body count, is talky, and it basically concentrates on filming the forest locations along with the rich mansion and providing character development with these 3 people. I thought the directing was good because I like Norman J Warren, but it's a slow film that's also cut.The DVD quality overall is very good, but I thought it could've been a little brighter.

'Escaflowne: The Movie' is essentially a re-telling or ""re-interpretation"" of the original TV series, but with literally everything from the original radically changed. This is not a good thing.Take the characters: it's bad enough that Van and Allen have been turned from fairly chivalrous heroes into ruthless men of action. But to make the awkward-but-endearing heroine Hitomi into a depressed borderline-suicide case is unforgivable. Why you'd want to butcher such a fantastic character, who became the pinup girl for geek guys everywhere, is beyond me. And the antagonists fare no better, with the well-developed Folken of the series reduced to a cardboard-cutout Bad Guy.Remember how the TV series contained elements from nearly every genre: mecha action, fantasy, drama, comedy, and romance? Well, very little has been retained here except the action. The epic feel of the series has been replaced by a more straightforward action-driven plot, and the mood is much darker and more intense than the original. The  animation quality certainly is an improvement on the original thanks to a movie-strength budget, but not even the best artwork will turn a poor anime into a good one.Really, you can hardly call this 'Escaflowne' at all.  None of the characters are how they used to be, the plot is a fairly derivative action-fest compared to the series, and the mood is more suited to a dark, violent thriller. It's hard to understand what the creators were hoping for with this movie....was it for the fans of the series or for newcomers? Either way, it fails at whatever it was trying to achieve, since newcomers will be confused and die-hard fans outraged. Obivously somebody forgot that you don't mess with a winning formula.I strongly recommend the original TV series, which was one of my personal favourite anime.

""Le premier cercle"" has one great thing about it and it is, not surprisingly, Jean Reno himself. Sadly he and his charismatic acting is the only thing I can recommend about the film.Jean Reno is credible as Milo, head of the Malakian clan. Gaspard Ulliel (""A Very Long Engagement"" ""Hannibal Rising"") is his son Anton. Anton is beginning to be fed up with his father's business. Anton is also in love with a care worker Elodie (Vahina Giocante) and thinks of leaving his family when his father devises a plan for a big heist.This film may be promoted as a heist movie, but its ""heist"" is only uninteresting and unoriginal part of the narrative, which is more about the relations between Reno's character and others surrounding him. There is a shoot-out sequence, which is simply bland and uninspired. However, what is really frustrating is not the absence of ""big"" actions, but the lazy and unimaginative storytelling of the director Laurent Tuel. In spite of the decent jobs from the capable cast, the film fails to build up the tension. The strained relationships between characters lack emotional impact, which the film desperately needs.If you are an avid Jean Reno fan like me, you might love this one. He is as wonderful as ever, believable as concerned father and ruthless killer.

406569,6304195397,A2BC978GQQEA2A,6,11,2006-04-13,You Had To Be There,"Made for a pittance, initially released in just two theaters, ultimately grossing over ten million dollars, ""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song"" became the progenitor of the ""Blaxploitation"" film craze of the seventies. Considered a seminal film in African-American cinema, Director Van Peebles feels it influenced the independent film movement as a whole. Its jazzy editing and strong hero set it miles apart from the standard fare - one can see how African-American audiences could see this film as a long-overdue cinematic thunderbolt.The plot is simple. Sweetback (Van Peebles himself) has grown up in a bordello to become one of its central attractions. One night, he agrees to accompany a pair of police officers downtown for questioning. A murder case lacks suspects, and the gesture appears to be compensation for the force's lenience toward the establishment.En route to the interrogation, however, the police intercept a youth on the street and brutally beat him. Using his handcuffs, Sweetback kills both officers. The rest is a protracted chase, with Sweetback using his fists (among other body parts) to make his way to the border. The police question his companions, hot on his trail with guns, bloodhounds and (at one point) a helicopter.Van Peebles has an eye for a striking shot, and there's some vivid scenes of police officers brutalizing Sweetback's friend Beetle that get their point across. While its historic contribution is clear, ""Sweetback"" has little to offer modern audiences beyond its kitsch value. Van Peebles is a strong presence as the laconic hero, but there's not much in the way of narrative or memorable characters to savor. There's plenty of sex and violence to be had (the 'X' rating is fully earned), but it's episodic - much of the film seems to be an enormous montage of repeated street scenes and dialogue clips, and the effect rapidly becomes tiresome.Thirty years after its explosive release, ""Sweetback"" will remain compelling for film historians and students. Its torch has been passed on to to other filmmakers, but the pioneering effort itself has not dated well.PS - The DVD release has an interview with the director. Initially, it shares some formal similarities with the feature, but later it settles into some interesting (and amusing) anecdotes.PPS - I just saw ""Badasssss!"" (Mario Van Peebles' docudrama on how ""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song"" was made) last night (10/25). It makes for a great double feature, as it really helps you to understand how difficult that production was.",2.0,0.5454545454545454,1,1,0.0,neutral,0.9496,very positive,2006,4,13

This is Sly's worst film, written or otherwise. Well, his acting is on par, but not great.A major flaw, I believe, is how they minimized Ivan Drago to a mere caricature of himself with no personal history or character development. It did make it easier to hate the Russian and also made it easier to like Rocky. In fact, it's a ridiculous habit this series has throughout. I felt like there was history trying to be shown in Drago's character (new trainer in, old trainer out), but they wanted a cartoon instead of a movie with guts.A cheap exploitation on over-ratcheted feelings during the Cold War. But it all gets so much worse...It can not be forgiven that a boxer would throw a referee to the floor before the bell, keep hitting his opponent after the bell--and still win the fight! There has never been place in time where that is even remotely possible. Yet, it is written. How is this? How is it that Rocky just sat there like a baby and did not even get physical with Ivan Drago? That is not possible, for it is completely out of sync with the subtext of Rocky's rage ""switch,"" as developed in the first three sequels. In life, it would have been a me-lay. In the case of Rocky, it needed to be as such. It was a must. All respect is lost for him after this.By now, the characters are all clich&eacute;s of themselves; the montages are all ridiculously cheesy and time consuming (for a reason; substance). It is just very bad. What is worse is how superficial and void this film is. When Rocky takes off in his Ferrari after Creed's death, the cinematographer has no problem stealing a few shots of the Ferrari's badge plate. So, they could not even do Apollo's death justice with a decent montage.This stuff matters when millions of dollars are invested in a motion picture. To me it does, anyway.

Poor John runs out of options before taking the gun to get life for his son.For me, the movie lacks the objective. Will gun be the answer for all?

Boy was I in for a surprise! To be sure, it was different, just not in a good way. Had the film been more aptly titled (something like ""Jack Goes to Sleep"" or even ""Jill Had the Good Sense to Clear Out Long Before They Made This Turkey""), a couple hours of my life that I will never get back certainly would have been better spent.Dull character, dull dialogue and - spoiler alert! - dull plot. In your typical romantic comedy, you KNOW the guy is going to get the girl in the end, but the whole reason for watching is finding out how the two overcome numerous and improbable difficulties to become one in the forgone conclusion. Now don't get me wrong, the last thing the world needs is ANOTHER romcom; I'm merely pointing out that formula does produce the occasional flick worth watching. ""Jack Goes Boating"" messes with that formula on several levels. It's short on both romance and comedy, and long on, well, being long. Middle-aged and dysfunctional Connie is frigid in a lukewarm sort of way. Her paramour, the middle-aged and dysfunctional Jack, is socially inept and sports the homeless look, which is curious, considering his profession as a limo driver. Early in the movie, Jack hooks up with Connie, and there's never any reason for them to break up, so they don't. That's the story, with some padding and a subplot not worth going into here. Really, the whole thing could have been comfortably fit into a 90-second trailer. To beef up this paltry scrap into a full-length feature, the filmmakers show Jack learning how to swim and taking cooking lessons. One action-packed scene has Jack filling out a job application AND submitting it to a prospective employer! In the spirit of public service, the fimmakers use ""Jack Goes Boating"" as a vehicle to point out the rather obvious - an unintended consequence of drug use can include burnt casserole. Perhaps most surprisingly, our new couple overcomes their sexual difficulties when Connie talks Jack into raping her! I know, I know, I know, it sounds crazy (but it's true, smoking hash really can be the death of an otherwise perfectly good dinner).And that, folks, is ""Jack Goes Boating.""

When set free and loose, Lewis can be as manically annoying as Robin Williams and seem like nothing more than an adult with attention deficit disorder in serious need of medicine. When reined in and forced to tone down the volume on his antics and perosonality (someone needed to tell Lewis that simply making a lot of geeky facial grimaces and spastic movements does not constitute comedy), he is capable of developing his ideas into good comedy that elevates him from being yesterday's Adam Sandler to Laurel and Hardy quality status. Lewis also needed to be told that a Chaplin or a Keaton he would never be (Lewis was far too vulgar and not intelligent enough) but that there was nothing wrong with developing his own character of the schmo.This film lacked a good script. The appropriation of the Cinderella story is weak and was only sturdy enough to support a tv sketch - not a movie. The direction is merely competent - but there are signs that Tashlin wouldn't or couldn't control Lewis (many scenes go on forever and editing was needed). Lewis has a few good moments miming to a Count Basie piece that show how good his timing could be. Mostly though, this is a bad movie.And that is what can be frustrating about Lewis: the talent is there; it just is allowed to lie dormant through far too many bad, bad movies.

John Waters, for years now has been saying he only likes to make movies with &quot;edge&quot;. They say they want to break away from formula Hollywood and make daring, bold, films. Movies that lack convention. I admit, I do enjoy seeing something different. I like movies that try to experiment with new techniques. But, I also noticed that many of these young new filmmaker are forgetting something. They are so worried about &quot;breaking the rules&quot;, they are so concerned with creating odd situation after odd situation, just so they can say they're films are different and they are a work of art, that they leave out one of the most fundamental rules of movies. The audience has to care about the characters. When I watch a movie I don't care if the lead character is a man or woman, whether or not they share my same ideas of politics, religion, or whatever. All I ask is that I at least find the character to be interesting enough, where I'm willing to give my emotions to the character. That's what makes a great movie. When the movies is over, we feel we ourslves have went through the same journey as the characters in the film. Once in a while a movie will remember this rule. David Lynch's &quot;Mulholland Dr.&quot; was one of those movies. It was one of the most mind-blowing complex movies I've seen in a while. But, Gore Verbinski's &quot;The Ring&quot; is a movie that just didn't move me the way it could have or should have.I see a lot of people enjoy this movie. They find the movie to be scary, and how can I tell someone who thinks something is scary it isn't? That's like telling someone don't laugh at that joke, I didn't find it funny. But, &quot;The Ring&quot; just gets a little too odd for it's own good. Now, don't get me wrong, the movie starts off well. And I do admire Naomi Watts as an actress. I think she is very talented. I even wanted to see this movie when it was released. So, I was going into the movie with high expectations. I wanted to like. But &quot;The Ring&quot; lost my attention in the middle and through the end. The movie just becomes and series of bizarre events where, for me, 1+1 doesn't equal 2. Think of Kafka but without the brains. Is it surreal? Yes. Does it make sense? Not really. Could the movie work? Yes.I haven't seen the original foreign version of this movie. Now, it may be better or it may be worst. But if it's as werid as this movie, I don't want to see it.&quot;The Ring&quot; tells the story of a woman (Naomi Watts) who learns about a video tape that has a collection is meaningless things on it, but, after I think it was 7 days, whoever watches the tape dies. Of course the movie goes into other things, and there is more added to the story, but, I'll let you rent the movie to find out what. I've given you a vague summary of the movie. Believe it or not, but in the beginning of the movie the story works. I didn't find the movie to be scary, but, I did find it to be interesting, and that's all I really ask of any movie. Just be able to hold my interest. And &quot;The Ring&quot; does reach it goal. It's actually enjoyable to watch at first, and than, it gets werid. Now, I know what all of you are thinking. I just said I liked &quot;Mulholland Dr.&quot; and that was a werid movie, so what's my problem here? How ever werid &quot;Mulholland Dr.&quot; may have got, it always held my interest. I wanted to see how the movie would end because I cared enough about the character to know. I didn't really care enough about the characters in &quot;The Ring&quot; to care how it ended. And that breaks the movie. If they just would of added a bit of logic to the movie. If they would of made the movie more believeable I could of enjoyed it more. Isn't that what makes a movie scary? If what is happening in the movie seems real enough that it could happen in real life? Those are the kinds of movies that scary me. Not this kind of movie.Are there things to be enjoyed while watching this movie. Well, if your a young filmmaker and you say you like to see movies with an &quot;edge&quot;, here you go! If you like Naomi Watts, and want to her all her movies again, here you go. Watts does in all fairness do a good job. She does give the character a certain level of heart need to carry our interest, but, it seems like no one else is helping her out. One person can't carry a movie by themself. Especially this type of movie.Bottom-line: Has some good points to it, but, over-all I wasn't scared by the movie. It gets too odd, and the audience can't really connect with anyone or anything.

703160,B000067J13,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,1,3,2005-10-11,A Big Waste of Time,"""Happy Campers"" is a useful movie only because it prompts basic questions about its writer/director Daniel Waters and his breakout film ""Heathers"" (which he wrote but did not direct). Did he use up all his good stuff writing the Heathers screenplay and have nothing left for ""Happy Campers? Did he lose most of his active brain cells shortly after making Heathers (an event that would account for both the 'Hudson Hawk""and the ""Happy Campers"" screenplays)? Was Heathers just a happy accident? Or is Heathers so open-ended that critics and viewers attributed significance to a very ordinary movie. All these explanations are possible either jointly or collectively.For ""Happy Campers"" Waters tries to weave ""Breakfast Club"" themes into a ""Meatballs"" story. So you get tedious voice-over suggestions about how the artificial bounds of the high school hierarchy can sometimes be bridged by spending a couple months together as summer camp counselors. Like each detention server in ""The Breakfast Club"", each counselor is an easily identified stereotype. And over the course of camp each is supposed to go through changes, at least that appears to be the premise.Unfortunately the script has difficulty communicating this process despite an unprecedented amount of voice-over narration. All seven of the main characters get some voice-over time, a device that is very confusing and pretty much destroys any possibility of the movie having any unified theme.Dominique Swain has the biggest part as Wendy, the terminally peppy cheerleader type (appropriately pictured in a cheerleader outfit on the DVD). Swain is the only good thing about the movie, it is an over-the-top caricature that plays to her acting strengths. This is the type of role Swain should be playing, one that requires self-parody rather than subtlety. She also benefits by relative comparison to James (Jaime) King-whose acting skills are in the Kathy Ireland mold, as well as from being paired with the physically miscast Brad Renfro-who manages to drain all energy from each scene in which he appears. The other four counselors have a fair about of screen time and some lame misadventures but nothing particularly memorable.Some effort is made to introduce the actual summer campers to the story but none of it even remotely works. ""Meatballs"" was able to get away with shallow character development because it was basically just a Bill Murray vehicle. Although Swain might have been able to carry the whole thing like Murray the script does not allow this and things never really get going in ""Happy Campers"".Waters apparently believed that audiences would react positively to a movie where 90% of the comedy involved sexual references that most preteens would consider moronic. Hey Daniel, did you pay someone to write that Heathers"" screenplay for you.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",2.0,0.3333333333333333,2,1,-0.4215,negative,0.9953,very positive,2005,10,11
1099151,B000V6LSOA,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,2,6,2008-04-20,Just. Die. Already.,"I was looking forward to this film when first announcements were made. An all-star cast, a screenplay adapted by Michael Cunningham, whose work on The Hours I admire. (I admit I am unfamiliar with the work of Susan Minot, who wrote the book.) So what happens when you put all these sure-fire ingredients in a pot and set to boil?Sadly, not much.Evening is the flattest two hours I've been through in a while. We spend our time with a rather boring woman who chews her pillowcase while dying and takes forever to shuffle off.  (I had this image of her two daughters downstairs mixing cyanide into her medicine to speed things along.) While she's dying she flashes back to one weekend in her life, a weekend that, all in all, is pretty ordinary. If this is what she flashes back to as her greatest moments on earth, she must have had a dull life. Did she ever do anything *really* exciting, like order pizza?Evening is supposed to be tinged with regret and sadness and all that weepy stuff. Fair enough, but we never really understand why all the regret, why Harris (Patrick Wilson) was her only love, or why that one weekend in her life stayed with her forever. Sure, they're telling us she made the wrong choice, but we don't really see why he was the right choice.  Of course, late in the film we get the almost obligatory scene where they meet up years later, each has settled down to apparently tepid marriages, and they still harbor desire for each other. (""I still remember which stars are ours! And hey, I just named Sputnik after you, too!"") To add corn to the cob, he mentions that his new son is named--got your kleenex ready?--Buddy!  Claire Danes can play these kinds of scenes so well there ought to be a special Academy Award just for her. But despite her Herculean efforts, and the fine acting by her costar and Gap khaki conspirator Patrick Wilson, the moment is so clich&eacute;d it nearly degenerates into self-parody.The film is much too checkerboarded. There are too many pointless flashbacks and flash-forwards. You should not go back and forth unless you have a reason to interrupt the story flow, but time after time when we change times, nothing new has happened since the last time we left. Particularly with the Redgrave scenes, she just lies on the bed, mutters something linking to the past, and we flash back there. So why did we bother to come back to the present in the first place?The interwoven story of the contemporary daughters, played by Toni Collette and Miranda Richardson, is heavy-handed. Oh yes, restless Collette is urged by mommy not to repeat her mistakes and to ""try to be happy!"" Boo-hoo. The other daughter...well, what the heck *does* the other daughter do? Nothing, really. She doesn't even talk to her dying mother much.And then there's Hugh Dancy, as Buddy, who was only a minor character in the book but who is made a major player in the screenplay. Despite having his part lengthened, the writers didn't give him much depth. He comes on as the classic slacker, and it's quickly established that his best friend is Jack Daniels. He spends most of his time on screen getting drunk, and the filmmakers telegraph his eventual fate with semaphores. He too has the hots for Ann. (All the guys in this movie have the hots for Ann; all the chicks have the hots for Harris, except that Buddy also seems to have the hots for Harris. It plays like an episode of ""Soap."") Yet we really don't get why. Ann is very sweet and kind to him early on, seemingly wanting to rekindle something old. Yet when he finally reveals his feelings for her, she explodes at him and tells him to get a life. It's one of those Dramatic Moments that's completely unearned; it seems to come from nowhere, and instead of being emotionally-moved we are just left puzzled. (The other male lead is equally shallow: what is so special about Harris? As played by Patrick Wilson, he's stiff and charmless and not even especially handsome, yet we're supposed to see him as a chick magnet. The story never bothers to show why. Explaining the motivation of any of these characters seems beneath it.  They want our tears without earning them.)Also puzzling to me is the scene where Ann sings after the wedding. In the middle, uninvited and unasked, Harris gets up, climbs onstage and joins her, turning her solo that she's been rehearsing all week into a duet. Maybe the filmmakers thought this was somehow tender or an indication of how they belonged together; me, I thought it was obnoxious. This wasn't open mike night, and nobody asked him to sing. Maybe if afterwards he'd told her how wonderful she'd been, if he seemed to appreciate her in ways the others hadn't, it would have played better.Evening smacks of trying to be about more than it was. It has this feeling of a deep and profound secret, but it never comes. We keep waiting for the magic moment to tie it all together, but we never get one.The best thing about the movie is Danes. I type that so often in movies she is in that I ought to install a macro on my computer. Claire Danes can make my eyes tear...just by being Claire Danes. I don't know how she does it, but for just one example, there's a scene near the end of her cooking and trying to be a 50's domestic housewife that, for some reason I can't explain, really got to me. If some other actress played the part, it wouldn't have worked. Why, I don't know, except to say there's something very pure and very real that she manages to telegraph. The producers say she was the first person they thought of when they set about casting. They were smart to do so.The rest of the cast does well, too, but they can't hide the fact that Evening--the film at least; can't comment on the novel--really isn't about much.  But it thinks it's about a lot. And it takes its sweet time telling it.The DVD transfer looks beautiful. The location for this movie is breathtaking, and filmmakers milk it for all its worth, with no shortage of vivid colors and pastel sunsets. The two bonus featurettes are of the kissy-kissy ""I'm-working-with-the-most-talented-people-in-the-world"" variety.",2.0,0.3333333333333333,2,1,-0.5994,negative,0.9982,very positive,2008,4,20

Of course it may ultimately be a story worth filming, if only for us to be yet again astonished at what else the human psyche is capable of inflicting on those who least deserve it.

Yes, even by the standards of slasher films.Firstly, the central characters are investigating the disappearence of other characters. When one of them vanishes, the others are focused on their disappearence. Understandable, but these people rarely talk about anything else. There's some talk on their army training and that's about it. They have very little personnality.Secondly, the Skeleton Man himself uses weapons such as a sword, lance, bow, etc. Generally speaking, don't slasher movie fans want to see inventive deaths?Also, at some time  the Skeleton Man has some kind of connection or relevence to birds of prey but it's not really explained. It's also reasonably long for a slasher movie, but there's a lot more deaths than I've seen in any other slasher movie, so I guess the movie being longer doesn't change much.Aside from being sub-par in the most important elements of a slasher movie, this movie isn't all that bad .

In some scenes, Brando manages to mimic Chaplin perfectly, and it works. In other scenes, he still mimics Chaplin, but the result is less effective. (As a devout Method actor, Brando repeatedly clashed with Chaplin, whose directorial style consisted of having the actors mimic his movements and delivery exactly). Sophia Loren is well-cast as the former Russian countess-turned-dance hall girl who stows away with the newly-appointed ambassador to Saudi Arabia (Brando). Aside from a major error in Chaplin's script (that is, that Loren's character is supposed to have left Russia in the revolution of 1917, which would make her character quite a bit older than she is), Loren plays the role with a comic grace that is both captivating and charming. The supporting cast have their moments: Sydney Chaplin as Brando's friend and advisor, Tippi Hedren as his estranged wife, Margaret Rutherford, in a delightful cameo as an elderly passenger aboard the ocean liner, and in a particularly memorable standout performance, Patrick Cargill as Brando's valet. Cargill shows a gift for comic timing and understated delivery here that makes the viewer wish he had been given more opportunities to demonstrate his talent. He nearly walks away with every scene he's in, and remains perhaps the most memorable part of the film.Chaplin's use of color and widescreen is appropriately understated in keeping with his style. However, it is in Chaplin's direction that we begin to see the limits of his filmmaking ability, at least in his later works. The cinematography is appropriately understated; however, it is in the editing that the pace of the film begins to bog down. Scenes requiring a frantic pace are edited entirely too slow, losing much of the comic rhythm between the performers. Many scenes are played out in single, long takes, without much interaction between the performers within the frame (they instead appear to have been instructed to stay ""on their mark"" and deliver their dialog).Perhaps the film's most memorable aspect is its lush orchestral score composed by Chaplin, and featuring the great ""This is My Song"", which re-appears throughout the film. Chaplin's abilities as a composer at this point had perhaps outmeasured his abilities as a filmmaker, and-fortunately for future audiences-he spent the next decade composing scores to his silent features of the 1920s.Universal's DVD of ""A Countess from Hong Kong"" is an excellent transfer in anamorphic widescreen.

But I will say, when I saw this in the theater (paying the long buck for it), I was swayed by the reviewers who said it was a twisty and twisted homage to all the horror cliches we've all grown up with.

It was, for me, gratuitously bloody and ugly with an attitude that said, ""Gore is wooooo scary"" (SCTV Count Floyd voice inserted here).To explain (A.): I KNOW we're not supposed to care about these characters.  They are cartoons, and they are supposed to be; that's why this is an homage.  Of course they're stereotypes: that's what's being parodied, for gosh sakes! I hated the Stoner--but come on, how many times do we need to laugh at a psychotropically configured moron (Jeff Spicoli, is this your kid?)before the stereotypes become stereotypes of themselves? I love homages, but not when they bring nothing new to the table with their characters.I suppose some folks who don't mind the constant barrage of doltish characters spouting the F-bomb (Note to filmmakers: If you want to appear ""edgy"" and on the cusp of ""hip,"" watch *The Big Lebowski* which uses profanity to further characterization and mood)--and you don't mind last-minute ""Time to up the violence quotient since we're running long and we don't want to alienate short-attention-span audiences with dialogue"" sequences--you may enjoy this film.But, Joss, where were your characteristic wit and joy that made us love *Buffy* and *Angel* and *Serenity*?

I bought it on the basis of customer reviews but it didn't do it for me.Look David's voice has improved in many ways since his Partridge Family Days and the talent is there but I wish he'd rethink his approach.If you like the Vegas show style of perpetual plastered smile on face and all numbers of an upbeat sort of style perhaps this is for you. I'm more into the rock angle and like more bite, emotion and grit and a feeling someone is laying bare their soul and emotion.I like variation in mood. If you are going to sing about heartache or sadness I like that mood to be embodied and expressed by the singer. However David has that beaming determined smile when he sings of being left and crying etc. Is he really that happy and joyful because there is almost a mask-like quality to it that looks trained for stage?The odd thing is that I remember the original TV show when he used to have quite a haunting sad and reflective look when he did express that sort of variation in mood. So he seems to have left his acting behind in favour of broadway show resolute cheeriness.The other problem is superficial and trivial but it completely distracted me - his hair! He is a little receding now (no big deal) but he wears it in a tight off-the-face rocker style which has been coiffed to add a little more height so it looks even more severe. It is VERY severe and a marked contrast to the soft and sexy look he used to have with more hair tumbling over his forehead - gee, I'm still a child of the 60s and I do like soft, sexy, slightly longer hair rather than military precision!The songs? - Really uneven for me - a couple I had to skip tracks. 'Cherish' I found quite painful for instance. However 'Aint no sunshine' was shaping well - except for his cheerfulness about the lack of sunshine with his girl gone! 'Hush' had potential that slowing down a bit and putting some real emotion and depth into it would have brought to completion.So if you think I'm being picky when the guy to you just looks happy all the time, and you are into a Vegas-show style, don't care if all emotions are expressed one-dimensionally, you like a more severe haircut- or you are a fan no matter what - go for it.As a casual explorer it wasnt for me and it's a pity because from what I heard from his voice he's got the talent, with a different haircut he's still got the looks, and from what I recall of his acting he could really sink into those songs and really connect to the heart if he went for singing the meaning of the songs he chooses.Time for an upgrade and to rethink David- unless your dedicated fans like the more bubble gum style.",2.0,0.625,1,1,-0.2263,negative,0.9933,very positive,2005,2,28
1313227,B002ZG99QS,A18G7GG53G2X8A,13,44,2010-12-17,This Movie Needs a System Reboot,"Is it wrong of me to prefer logic over spectacle? Did I miss the point when I left ""Tron: Legacy"" feeling it was a monumental failure as a story? If I'm to continue with this review, I must first make it clear that I don't see the ""Tron"" films in the same way a lot of people do. I don't believe they deserve praise simply for their innovative special effects; I personally require an engaging plot, character development, and the sense that it's operating under a heightened but nonetheless understandable set of rules. In other words, I like a good sci-fi/fantasy film, but not when all effort is put into visuals and absolutely nothing is put into the screenplay. If that makes me a prude who wouldn't know a cool movie even if it came up and bit me, feel free to stop reading and start searching the web for a more enthusiastic review.Just like its 1982 predecessor, watching ""Tron: Legacy"" is a little like watching a demo reel from the visual effects department - all flash and bang but no substance. It makes not the slightest effort to be plausible or consistent, it freely glosses over glaring technicalities, the dialogue is unbelievably awkward, and the performances are wasted on characters with no depth. The plot is convoluted and impenetrable, and it seems the more it tries to explain, the less sense it makes. The entire concept of people living inside a computer is a logistical nightmare, but if I start rattling off a list, I fear I might not be able to stop. Its greatest offense is not having any audience in mind other than the original film's fan base, which, when you think about, hardly seems big enough to have warranted a sequel in the first place.I will admit that the film is a dazzling sight to behold. I was especially impressed with work done on the character of Clu, a hacking program; he was designed to look exactly like his creator, Kevin Flynn, but since people age and computer programs do not, it was necessary to digitally reconstruct the face of Jeff Bridges as it appeared over twenty years ago. The results are uncannily convincing. With just a little more development, we may someday see digital recreations of bygone Hollywood icons and not notice a difference. Imagine it - Humphrey Bogart acting alongside Ingrid Bergman in a sequel to ""Casablanca.""Since the events of the first film, Flynn got married, had a son, became a widower, and was promoted to CEO of a computer corporation called ENCOM International. He disappeared in 1989, leaving behind his son, Sam, and vague promises of a cutting edge digital revolution, one he claimed would forever change science, medicine, and religion. The story begins twenty years later, when a now twenty-seven-year-old Sam (Garrett Hedlund) breaks into ENCOM headquarters, distributes their newest operating system over the internet for free, uploads a virus into their mainframe, and escapes by jumping off the rooftop and releasing a parachute he just happened to have stowed away on his person. After his arrest and release, Sam is approached by ENCOM's consultant and Flynn's old friend Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner), who says he received a page from Flynn's office, the number of which has been disconnected for twenty years. So help me God, the man is still using a pager.Upon entering his father's abandoned arcade, Sam discovers a secret room with a miraculously functional computer and a fully operational laser; with a few careless strokes of the keyboard, Sam is zapped with light and transported into the computer world, known as the Grid. We then witness must have been an homage to the sepia-tone-to-Technicolor transition shown in ""The Wizard of Oz""; the film shifts from 2D to 3D, which is a new one on me. Sam is immediately captured by electronically-voiced guards in black suits with glowing orange stripes. After being stripped of his earthly clothes, fitted with a black suit with glowing blue stripes, and linked with a memory-storing disc that doubles as a Frisbee, he's pitted against Flynn's program, Clu (Jeff Bridges), who has since turned evil. He's then forced to participate in games of survival, including a race on digital motorcycles that trail light behind them. He's rescued by a program named Quorra (Olivia Wilde) and driven away from the city into the surrounding mountains. Mountains. In a computer grid. And there are clouds in the sky, too.I will now stop describing the plot and move on to some of the little things that drove me mad. There's a house stocked with furniture, physical paper books, and food. I must assume it's not some digital replication, for Sam is able to eat it without a problem. There's a club high atop a sky rise in the heart of the computer city, where a program played by Michael Sheen struts around with a cane and speaks like a Dr. Frank N. Furter wannabe. There's an ending which begs the question of how anything created in a computer could ever exist in the physical human world. After all, it's all just a bunch of immaterial zeros and ones. The fact that I'm fixated on this when I'm supposed to be enjoying myself should tell you everything you need to know. ""Tron: Legacy"" is a horrendous miscalculation, one of the least understandable films to come along in quite some time.",2.0,0.2954545454545454,7,2,0.0,neutral,0.99,very positive,2010,12,17

1236547,B001TJKW0E,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,2,2,2009-10-11,wildly uneven paean to India,"**1/2""Delhi 6"" is a messy and overlong - though frequently appealing - tale of a young American man who travels to India to rediscover his roots.  When his grandmother is diagnosed with diabetes, Roshan agrees to accompany her back to the land of her birth so she can end her life at the same place where she began it.  While there, Roshan learns a thing or two about a culture he's been largely sheltered from in his life in New York.  This includes taking the bad along with the good:  the sense of community along with the antiquated caste system; the respect for tradition along with the adherence to ancient superstitions; the respect for law-and-order along with the corruption and cronyism of the police and politicians; the technological advances along with a scarcity of resources like electricity and water; the arranged marriages along with the flowering of true love.  That latter is particularly crucial to the story as Roshan falls for a beautiful, independent-minded woman whose father wants to marry her off to a man of his choosing even though her heart's desire is to perform as a singer on the popular TV show ""Indian Idol.""Like most mainstream movies made in India, ""Delhi 6"" provides a relatively upbeat, prettified look at life in that country.  Any hint of poverty is pushed to the background, while the foreground becomes an almost nonstop dizzying swirl of music and color.  And I do mean ""nonstop,"" for if there is one thing ""Delhi 6"" has in abundance it's musical sequences, some of which drag on for an insufferably long time, adding an unnecessary burden to the movie`s overall running time.  The film also culminates in an overwrought scene that feels like a bizarre melding of ""West Side Story"" with ""Carousel.""So what's likable about ""Delhi 6""?  Well, its cultural observations are sometimes compelling, particularly its portrayal of the tension that exists between Hindus and Muslims in that nation.  Also, the actors (Abhishek Bachchan, Sonam Kapoor, et. al.) are both physically attractive and energetic.  And while the humor occasionally veers towards the goofy and the ""villainous"" figures are largely two-dimensional stereotypes, the movie has a genuine affection for its characters and country (flaws and all) that finally wins us over.",2.0,1.0,14,1,0.0,neutral,0.9843,very positive,2009,10,11
1047168,B000MMLP9G,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,1,2,2013-09-19,Shion Sono strikes again but atleast this one describes the film well.,"Because it is Strange!I have seen too many Shion Sono films and have come to realize how redundant his movies are not to mention how terrible the endings always are. If you like gory bloody violence, gratuitous sex, abstract plots that deviate from reality, and unsatisfying endings that don't bother to explain the reasons for anything you just watch than you my friend will enjoy the films Shion Sono creates. Me on the other hand I'm tired of them and tired of getting burned at the end when I find out the ending is as pointless as the movie itself. Sure, show me violence, show me random sex, but show me a logical reason for it or at least try to have it make sense. For those that don't know are perhaps aren't familiar with Japanese culture Japanese or really Asian films in general usually have some hidden point in them that makes a statement about their countries economic standing,socialism,politics, government, cultural standpoints,societal views etc. etc. etc. There is usually one of these underlying statements in their movies most of the time. Shion Sono likes to take one of those themes and make the most abstract movies around them. Some people like to call it artistic, some like to call it a masterpiece but to other people that see between the lines we call it bull@%$#. These movies appeal to either people that like Gory films (that usually need no plot),people that like sexually perverse films (that like porno's also need no plot), or people that like to blend both of these two worlds into their movies natural born killer style. What's funny is that in the USA Shion Sono is more famous for his gory film Suicide Club. Especially when clips from it circulate over the internet. It's the shock of the gore that lures people into watching and it's what they come for. Not the story, not his message, not any of these. They come for the gore, and ironically that's what his films are renowned for being shocking and gory. Just like M. Night Shyamalan is known for his ""Plot Twist"" endings to the point where it's a pop culture joke now. Some ""homemade"" intellectuals will watch his films and say it's the best most sophisticated film they ever saw and ""you just don't get it"". While others who realize these films are just made by a man that enjoys making gory,violent, and explicative films with a hidden message inside them like a fortune cookie as means to justify the awkward films he creates. It be kind of like Wes Craven saying he made Freddy Krueger to illustrate the twisted mind of a child killer and not because he wanted to make a slasher movie with a good villain. I guess with Shion Sono's films it's like one of those ink blot test. Some see a pretty butterfly and others just see an inkblot. With this film all I see is an ink blot smeared on excuse to create a violently perverted film. I wouldn't go as far to call Shion Sono films ""pretentious"" that be more like an insult. He actually puts a lot of work and thought into his films and while strange they are still filmed and performed well but the way they are executed just is never to my taste.Side note the acting is very good and the women look good too.",2.0,0.5,1,1,0.2263,positive,0.9892,very positive,2013,9,19
1505861,B005ZI6NHG,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,13,16,2012-04-01,Two Heads Are Better Than One,"""2-Headed Shark Attack"" is the latest ridiculous sea monster flick from The Asylum. Before you can even get to the film there's an intro from The Asylum bragging how they have done over 100 of these cheesy disaster films so far, and the beauty is that if you've seen one you pretty much know what's going to happen in any of the others: just substitute ""two-headed shark"" for ""giant alligator,"" ""enormous squid,"" or ""subterranean volcano under a metropolis"" and you've got it. As the credits unwind to obnoxious college students on a speedboat, creature feature fans may feel the hairs on the back of their neck stand up when they see the director is Christopher Douglas-Olen Ray. With B-movie genetics like this you know it's going to be an entertaining movie for all the wrong reasons. Not that I fault Chris Ray, it's not like anyone was going to make a good movie called ""2-Headed Shark Attack"" or anything. You know what you're buying when you see the title.The opening starts the production off right. Two talented water skiers in bikinis are pulled behind a boat towed by three ogling guys taking their pictures. I therefore found it a bit incredulous that nobody in the boat noticed when a giant two-headed shark leapt from the water and neatly munched them down. Not that it matters. The real meat of the story, the chum as it were, starts when we meet Professor Babbish (Charlie O'Connell) who is taking his class of insufferable students on a ""semester at sea"" to learn...well, something. It starts off with a lesson in sextant use, but quickly turns to a sunbathing demonstration. They are on a typical Florida tourist boat...no I'm sorry, a ""US education vessel,"" the ""Sea King,"" sailing ""hundreds of miles from anywhere"" and immediately sustain shark damage via a curious scene that you may not find entirely plausible. In the process the shark damages their radio antenna (ponder) and they cannot communicate with anyone. The interesting point is that bonehead jock Cole (Geoff Ward) was scolded to turn his cell phone off not more than five minutes earlier. But never mind, they are really, really stuck at sea with a crippled boat. Just take our word for it.The dialogue is predictably ridiculous (""We're not sinking. We're taking on water."") Fortunately by an amazing coincidence a deserted island is right next to them. For some reason they decide to send the Professor and students ashore to look for scrap metal to repair the boat (really?) while Mrs. Anne Babbish (Carmen Electra, who is clearly here only because of her name and sundry assets, not because of any contribution to the plot whatsoever) is in charge of vessel repairs. She has two Spanish speaking deckhands who work hard and Laura (Morgan Thompson) the lovely welder to do the work. That's a good thing, because as senior officer onboard with her ship sinking what do you think she does? Well, obviously she changes into a bikini and soaks up some rays on deck. While all that's going on, the kids are getting into petulant arguments and exploring the island, and believe me they cannot get eaten fast enough for my taste. I hope that shark is famished.If the plot isn't enough to make you laugh out loud, the acting and terrible CGI will. I have some seen some awful shark movies, but this is one of the worst on a whole bunch of levels. The effects are utterly laughable, and among the least scary of any of The Asylum movies. (That's saying something.) I truly enjoy how the entire scale of the shark varies by orders of magnitude throughout the film. Bonus points for that. The backstory unspools in an even sillier way than you would expect: voluptuous, angst-laden, uptight blonde heroine Kate (Brooke Hogan, Hulk's daughter) enrolled in the semester at sea because she was spooked by a shark in the ocean when she was 12, and hasn't been in the water since then. This is not how normal human beings make decisions. As they explore the deserted island which has well-developed roads, infrastructure, and even a church, they discover two boats which prompts the line ""Hey guys do you think these will work?"" For what? What part of ""boat"" don't they understand? What was the point of going to the island again? Never mind. Fortunately Kate is an engineering-mechanic-welding savant and fixes the boats with the help of smart guy Paul (David Gallegos,) the only remotely likeable member of the cast, while idiot Cole almost kills himself with a spear.It sure was lucky they found this island, wasn't it? Oh, but wait! The shark is making the island have earthquakes and sink into the ocean! The first earthquake injures the Professor's leg to the point he needs to be ferried back to the ""Sea King"" (why did they ever leave again?) Fortunately they forget about this as he is able to run again within two hours. Assorted mayhem occurs with much CGI thrashing and foam teeth in attendance while idiotic canned interpersonal conflicts occur in abundance. Cole steals one boat for the cool kids, leaving Kate and Paul on the other. Oddly many of the students elect to stay on the sinking island as the boats race toward the ""Sea King."" This scene will have you praying for natural selection to work its wonders. Cole comes up with an ingenious plan to jump into the water and swim for the ""Sea King"" abandoning the boat's other occupants to the shark. Sadly Kate rescues Cole and when back in shallow water explains where their relationship stands in no uncertain terms.Because this is going nowhere everyone comes ashore, abandoning the ""Sea King."" (Oh, whatever.) While Cole emotes over the loss of his party buds, the Babbish clan comes up with a brilliant plan: sink the ""Sea King."" No, seriously. You mean that boat they just left floating over there? Yes. Apparently they believe that it would be safer than staying on the visibly sinking atoll, because that would trigger its EPIRB (they don't call it that) to summon help. Turns out you don't really have to do that, but for the plot to work that's the best idea they've got. Paul (the student who should be in charge because he's the only one who knows anything about the ocean, fish, or boats) comes up with an alternate plan: fix the ""Sea King."" Brilliant! There's an elaborate subplot about distracting the shark with an electric bridge (don't ask) while the Professor sends, of all people, archenemies Cole and Kate to fix the ""Sea King."" (Suspension of disbelief is key here, people.) A favorite moment is when Professor Babbish watches the shark and yells ""It's confused!"" For a moment I thought he was talking about the plot, but nope, just the fish. Kate starts welding to fix the amusingly fake ""hull damage"" while the shark gets tired of its electroshock therapy and destroys the bridge, freeing it up to do more important things. Like eating.Cole steals the ""Sea King"" as soon as the welding is complete, leaving Kate alone in the water. You'd have thought she was imperiled what with the giant mutant shark on the loose, but no, she just wades ashore. Suffice it to say that Cole doesn't get far, and the Professor's original plan is put into action, though this is lost on the cast for some reason. As the island sinks ever lower in the water, most people run inland, but two particularly dim coeds run to stand on the smallest, spindliest dock imaginable, then precariously perch on the very edge of said dock saying ""I think we're good."" What do you, the audience, think? Do you think huge two-headed sharks can leap clean over a dock? I won't tell.Because this in an Asylum movie, there's not quite enough going on yet, so what do you think could go wrong next? Volcano? Good guess, but wrong. Enormous altruistic intervening squid? Again, good guess, but no. How about this one: tidal wave. Sadly, it's true. As it strikes the island the Babbishes have one last kiss as they are engulfed simultaneously by the rogue wave and the central character of the film. To seek refuge from the shark the remaining kids seek refuge in a church, which the shark treats as a snack basket before getting hopelessly lost inside. (It's a small church, but sharks have small brains.) Paul even gets to beat it on the snout with a crucifix. I am so not joking. The film concludes with a wholly ridiculous plan and multiple acts of bravery, and Kate and Paul finally putting us out of our misery by climbing onto the rocks of the island and waiting for the rescue helicopter which promptly shows up as the credits start to some truly awful music.The DVD has a few extras, none of them good. There is a ""Gag Reel"" which consists of a couple of minutes of assorted clowning and bloopers. It may be the single lamest blooper reel I have ever seen. Don't waste your time. There are some trailers for this and other Asylum movies, and last but least, a ""Making Of Featurette."" This documentary interviews just about everyone including the costume designer (the ""costumes"" are shorts and bikinis...really, you needed a costume designer?) It goes without saying that this is pretty boring and self-congratulatory stuff. I was amused when they interviewed Brooke Hogan, the star of the show, that there was no audio of her answers. Nice bonus feature! Don't waste your time with this one either. I will save you the time by summing up: location shooting on water is difficult.""2-Headed Shark Attack"" is just another insane monster fish debacle from our friends at The Asylum, no more and no less. If you are looking for brainless B-movie hilarity, I suppose this could be a good choice. Most people will find the cast too obnoxious to endure for 90 minutes, though fans of the feminine form will likely be pleased. It's a given that it's a bad movie, but under the right circumstances, with the right group of people it could bring joy to fans of extraordinarily bad camp.

Actually, 8MM is an essentially routine thriller given a patina of originality by  being set in the sleazy world of hardcore, violent pornography.  Unfortunately, like most mainstream commercial productions, this film never  really explores this world in any depth, but uses it as window dressing for  a tired, by-the-numbers private eye meller.The film stars Nicholas Cage  as a Pennsylvania-based private investigator called in by a wealthy widow  to determine whether a &quot;snuff&quot; film she's found among her late  husband's personal possessions is the genuine article. Cage heads off to  Hollywood, the mecca of all things pornographic, hooks up with Joaquin  Phoenix as a Capote-reading porn shop clerk and all around nice guy, and  stumbles into a den of iniquity that leads him to the mystery's eventual  unraveling.Unlike a courageous film like 1984's &quot;Tightrope&quot;,  in which Clint Eastwood's cop character begins more and more to identify  with the sleazy world he's investigating and, in the process, unlocks dark,  hidden recesses buried deep within his own psyche, 8MM's main character  never seems even momentarily ensnared by the dark visions seeping into his  brain. Indeed, Cage's investigator remains morally superior throughout.  This allows for the film to settle for a routine, bloodsoaked revenge  melodrama resolution and to avoid having to develop and cope with a complex  central character. Even though director Joel Schumacher manages to create  an initial atmosphere of dark gloominess, it's essentially wasted in a  welter of action movie cliches and unconvincing heroics.Too bad that a  film that promises to open up a world on film unfamiliar to mainstream  audiences manages to make even pornography and all the denizens that toil  in it seem hopelessly humdrum.",2.0,0.6666666666666666,14,1,0.0,neutral,-0.631,very negative,2000,7,23

1061079,B000NVT0S4,A280GY5UVUS2QH,5,7,2008-04-11,Why Biopics are So  Bad,"Why Biopics are So Bad:Problem One: Biopics are notoriously reductive. Real people are complex but biopics are always trying to turn real people's real lives into storylines with plots, or worse: morality plays. Real life and real lives do not necessarily have plots from which we can parse meanings; people do not live so that their lives can be transformed into movies. Warhol may have thought fame was the ultimate drug, but most of his hangers-on made fun of the debacle that was stardom. The Warhol crew debunked Hollywood myths and icons and they mocked the Hollywood myth and icon making machine. They didn't really admire the famous anymore than they admired America, they wanted to expose the famous and the seedy underside of fame and in doing so expose America. Warhol and his factory workers turned fame and America into high camp. This was brilliant and this is what Edie was attracted to (I'm guessing). This biopic, however, makes it look as though Edie just didn't get it, and that she thought Andy was being sincere when he labeled her a ""superstar."" Ok, I never knew Edie but I doubt the filmakers did either; nevertheless, they have decided to take a reverent stance toward Edie and an irreverent one toward Andy. And present Edie as a victim and Andy as a victimizer. Why? Because you need a good conflict to make cinema seems to be the answer on these unimaginative filmmakers minds. This seems highly problematic for several reasons, but the primary reason why this way of thinking always equals bad art is because this kind of thinking requires that the adherents reject the complications of real life in favor of familiar fictive formulas; formulas that require that there always be two sides to every equation: good and bad guys, victims and exploiters, innocents and experienced artists/actors/social players. These filmakers simply cast aside reality and invent an ""Edie"" that fits the former and an ""Andy"" that fits the latter side of these simplistic binaries. This is insanely reductive. It also happens to be classic feminism, but with one glaring problem: Andy hardly fits the part of the classic ""exploitive male"" and Edie the part of the classic ""exploited female."" Its also ironic: this film takes two people who were famous for mocking American artistic and social and symbolic structures/paradigms (including its gender paradigms which were reified over and over again in Hollywood films) and turns them into formulaic players in the kind of movie that they would have loved to hate.Problem Two: It is VERY difficult to make a film about a real person, and especially a real person that living people still remember. The reason people become famous and achieve the iconographic status that they do has to do with indeterminable and unnamable factors. But the actors that play these enormous icons do not themselves possess those indeterminable and unnamable factors that made the original so unique and so striking. Just looking like someone doesn't qualify you to play them: look-a-like celebrities (even if the look-a-like is a celebrity in their own right) are always weak. Looking at someone doing a bad impersonation of Jack Nicholson just makes you feel sad for the world. We should be originals not bad copies. Biopic acting is always bad acting. Movie versions of real lives are always bad.No one will ever be able to play John F.Kennedy, or Elvis, or Mick, or Brian Jones, or John Lennon, or Bob Dylan, or Kurt Cobain.No one will be ever able to play Freida Kahlo, or Marilyn Monroe, or Edie Sedgwick, or Patti Smith.Unique people are unique. Actors can't play them. And impersonations always look like impersonations. Purposely bad impersonations are the only really good ones.Problem Three: The makers of biopics are bad historians. In most cases, history, to the crafter of a biopic, is the same as ambiance and is no more or less important than any other design element. In the cases when time period does matter, and historical context is respected as a significant factor in peoples lives, history is presented in caricature.  With the sixties in particular filmmakers have been especially inaccurate. They invariably get it wrong; either they over-sentimentalize or over-idealize the decade, or they judge its excesses. Factory Girl does the latter. It does not make the sixties look in any way attractive, rather the sixties through the eyes of this filmmaker just look filthy (as in grimy) and seedy and mean.Problem Four: Films with an agenda are always bad. This is a film with a feminist agenda. Feminism is not necessarily bad, but feminist films are always bad. Even if we take the film on its own feminist terms and consider the possibility that feminine muses often end up being victimized by those male artists that they inspire (Rodin's model and muse and apprentice Camille Claudel is another historical example)we still end up in a hopelessly reductive virtual land that has little to do with the actual world. The film begs us to see Edie as a helpless victim of her father's and Andy's and other prowling male's vile desires. But are we to assume her own desires/ambitions/manipulations are holy just because they are feminine?A Note on Ciao Manhattan: Ciao Manhattan is a fascinating and wonderfully trashy early 70's burn-out film. In it Edie plays an ""Edie""-like ""star"" whose coming down from a decade-long high surrounded by a number of B-movie characters.  It's fascinating because we think we are watching someone play themselves. But whether this is Edie being Edie or Edie playing an old version of herself or someone elses idea of her is impossible to tell. Biopics are never really about real life. They are products. They are about preconceived & pre-packaged ways of thinking about life, and second-hand and second-rate ways of thinking about life at that. Because its actually Edie on screen viewers want to believe this film is different than most biopics. Edie herself, however, seems much less interested in her reality or her myth than everyone else around her seems to be. Maybe at the factory she liked to be looked at, but in this film it seems Edie no longer feels like anyone that matters is looking anymore. In Ciao Manhattan she is always dazed & confused, she never really wakes up, its as if there is no longer anyone there to wake up for. Maybe for her life was a performance and in the end there was just no one left to perform for.The film is both a deconstruction of a star and a last act. So, gaudy & tasteless as it is (to turn someones pain & suffering into spectacle), there is something there (Edie herself) that transcends the usual biopic paradigms. And even though we feel guilty for looking, we can't seem to take our eyes off of her. Its as if there is something there that we want, that we need to know but we can never quite put our finger on it. That is the nature of stardom.Recommended for further viewing: Nicolas Roeg's Performance",2.0,0.7142857142857143,2,1,-0.5849,negative,-0.9823,very negative,2008,4,11

I've seen quite a few of his films and ever since watching it, Spider was my absolute least favorite of his. In fact, I hated that film. Well, Cosmpolis has now easily taken its place. This movie is so pretentious, bloated and dismally boring, that I'm not exactly sure what attracted such big stars as Juliette Binoche and Paul Giammati to join in. I'm excluding Rob Pattinson because I'm sure he was quite honored(and thankful) to be starring in such a different film coming off his Twilight streak.  Anyway, the plot revolves around a billionaire (Pattinson) who wants to get a haircut, way across town (Manhattan). His personal bodyguard/security is against this idea and numerous times throughout the film tries to veer him away from his haircut idea. Almost the entire movie takes place in his white stretch limo. Inside, he meets throughout the day with various people, some for business, some for pleasure. Oh yes, he even gets a prostrate exam(which he apparently does every day) in the limo by a doctor. At breakfast time and lunch he meets up with his wife, who is even more emotionally barren than he is. There is zero indication of what attracted these two to begin with. Aside from wealth (and their dead eyes), they seem to have nothing in common. Clearly, his character is a sociopath, a cheater and emotionally whacked. But none of these facts make the film any more interesting. In fact, I can't even count the times I nearly fell asleep. Too much talk, most of it seemingly random and not making much sense.

However, the movie wasn't exciting enough to keep it afloat beyond the dancing.  I don't know how many towns ban dancing in America in this day and age.  It may seem outlandish for some to fathom while watching this.  Clearly you'd need to keep the suspension of disbelief.  Dennis Quaid is fantastic as the dad of one of the teen girls and seems to be the only cast member who is a gifted actor.

The batch of them, Deborah, husband Jim (Flight of the Living Dead's David Chisum), and son Ian (Joshua Pelegrin in his first and, to date, last big-screen role), are moving out to the country to get away from it all. They look at an endless succession of houses, but there's one that they step into, and immediately Deborah is taken with it. (You've heard this before, right?) After dithering on so many other houses, when she says ""we'll take it"", Jim is thrilled he can finally stop looking at houses, and they do. Deborah soon learns that the house was originally inhabited by a reclusive, possibly crazy, painter who may or may not have killed his entire family and hidden them somewhere in the house. More importantly, their spirits may be trapped in the house's mirrors. (You've heard this before, right?)It gets better. The big twist ending has been done to death. In fact, the movie is often compared, and never favorably, to a classic flick that has the same twist ending.

1061079,B000NVT0S4,A280GY5UVUS2QH,5,7,2008-04-11,Why Biopics are So  Bad,"Why Biopics are So Bad:Problem One: Biopics are notoriously reductive. Real people are complex but biopics are always trying to turn real people's real lives into storylines with plots, or worse: morality plays. Real life and real lives do not necessarily have plots from which we can parse meanings; people do not live so that their lives can be transformed into movies. Warhol may have thought fame was the ultimate drug, but most of his hangers-on made fun of the debacle that was stardom. The Warhol crew debunked Hollywood myths and icons and they mocked the Hollywood myth and icon making machine. They didn't really admire the famous anymore than they admired America, they wanted to expose the famous and the seedy underside of fame and in doing so expose America. Warhol and his factory workers turned fame and America into high camp. This was brilliant and this is what Edie was attracted to (I'm guessing). This biopic, however, makes it look as though Edie just didn't get it, and that she thought Andy was being sincere when he labeled her a ""superstar."" Ok, I never knew Edie but I doubt the filmakers did either; nevertheless, they have decided to take a reverent stance toward Edie and an irreverent one toward Andy. And present Edie as a victim and Andy as a victimizer. Why? Because you need a good conflict to make cinema seems to be the answer on these unimaginative filmmakers minds. This seems highly problematic for several reasons, but the primary reason why this way of thinking always equals bad art is because this kind of thinking requires that the adherents reject the complications of real life in favor of familiar fictive formulas; formulas that require that there always be two sides to every equation: good and bad guys, victims and exploiters, innocents and experienced artists/actors/social players. These filmakers simply cast aside reality and invent an ""Edie"" that fits the former and an ""Andy"" that fits the latter side of these simplistic binaries. This is insanely reductive. It also happens to be classic feminism, but with one glaring problem: Andy hardly fits the part of the classic ""exploitive male"" and Edie the part of the classic ""exploited female."" Its also ironic: this film takes two people who were famous for mocking American artistic and social and symbolic structures/paradigms (including its gender paradigms which were reified over and over again in Hollywood films) and turns them into formulaic players in the kind of movie that they would have loved to hate.Problem Two: It is VERY difficult to make a film about a real person, and especially a real person that living people still remember. The reason people become famous and achieve the iconographic status that they do has to do with indeterminable and unnamable factors. But the actors that play these enormous icons do not themselves possess those indeterminable and unnamable factors that made the original so unique and so striking. Just looking like someone doesn't qualify you to play them: look-a-like celebrities (even if the look-a-like is a celebrity in their own right) are always weak. Looking at someone doing a bad impersonation of Jack Nicholson just makes you feel sad for the world. We should be originals not bad copies. Biopic acting is always bad acting. Movie versions of real lives are always bad.No one will ever be able to play John F.Kennedy, or Elvis, or Mick, or Brian Jones, or John Lennon, or Bob Dylan, or Kurt Cobain.No one will be ever able to play Freida Kahlo, or Marilyn Monroe, or Edie Sedgwick, or Patti Smith.Unique people are unique. Actors can't play them. And impersonations always look like impersonations. Purposely bad impersonations are the only really good ones.Problem Three: The makers of biopics are bad historians. In most cases, history, to the crafter of a biopic, is the same as ambiance and is no more or less important than any other design element. In the cases when time period does matter, and historical context is respected as a significant factor in peoples lives, history is presented in caricature.  With the sixties in particular filmmakers have been especially inaccurate. They invariably get it wrong; either they over-sentimentalize or over-idealize the decade, or they judge its excesses. Factory Girl does the latter. It does not make the sixties look in any way attractive, rather the sixties through the eyes of this filmmaker just look filthy (as in grimy) and seedy and mean.Problem Four: Films with an agenda are always bad. This is a film with a feminist agenda. Feminism is not necessarily bad, but feminist films are always bad. Even if we take the film on its own feminist terms and consider the possibility that feminine muses often end up being victimized by those male artists that they inspire (Rodin's model and muse and apprentice Camille Claudel is another historical example)we still end up in a hopelessly reductive virtual land that has little to do with the actual world. The film begs us to see Edie as a helpless victim of her father's and Andy's and other prowling male's vile desires. But are we to assume her own desires/ambitions/manipulations are holy just because they are feminine?A Note on Ciao Manhattan: Ciao Manhattan is a fascinating and wonderfully trashy early 70's burn-out film. In it Edie plays an ""Edie""-like ""star"" whose coming down from a decade-long high surrounded by a number of B-movie characters.  It's fascinating because we think we are watching someone play themselves. But whether this is Edie being Edie or Edie playing an old version of herself or someone elses idea of her is impossible to tell. Biopics are never really about real life. They are products. They are about preconceived & pre-packaged ways of thinking about life, and second-hand and second-rate ways of thinking about life at that. Because its actually Edie on screen viewers want to believe this film is different than most biopics. Edie herself, however, seems much less interested in her reality or her myth than everyone else around her seems to be. Maybe at the factory she liked to be looked at, but in this film it seems Edie no longer feels like anyone that matters is looking anymore. In Ciao Manhattan she is always dazed & confused, she never really wakes up, its as if there is no longer anyone there to wake up for. Maybe for her life was a performance and in the end there was just no one left to perform for.The film is both a deconstruction of a star and a last act. So, gaudy & tasteless as it is (to turn someones pain & suffering into spectacle), there is something there (Edie herself) that transcends the usual biopic paradigms. And even though we feel guilty for looking, we can't seem to take our eyes off of her.

A corporation is not a charity, its a business, if corporations main stakeholders in all considerations were the employees than they would not exist and no one would benefit from their existence. Considiering GM built Flint and Michael Moore's whole upbringing is a result of that company's employment of his father and grandfather, I can't understand what he expects this business he derides as evil to do. Just because you have a job today does not mean your entitled to a job for life, I know this is totally against Union way of thinking, but thank god for America the majority of us are well aware of this.  Showing the human side of job loss is very sad, but isn't this America and a business has the right where and how to run their business to become profitable.  I loved the fact that because of the UAW's entitlement contracts GM is broke today, well at least they got a Michael Moore sympathizer running the show now.This movie's message is dumb, it's basically that businesses owe more to employees than the paycheck and benefits they already receive.

I'm not a fan of movies that start out by heading in one direction only to halt in the middle of something and then backtracking with a new account: 2 days earlier.  This is especially irksome when the direction Boll was initially heading was too brief to establish anything but a few scattered images and an explosion; he might just as well have started the movie two days earlier!  Not that it would have made any difference as the timeline in this piece was suspect throughout.  Images were oft repeated, news reports kept chattering in the background announcing events that hadn't happened yet, were happening, or had just happened.  At any given moment, it was never certain what was taking place, was it real, was it about to happen, had it happened already, or were these just the conflicting images and random thoughts of a lunatic, or a very savvy bank robber?  I don't mind a little ambiguity now and then but not throughout an entire movie.  It's as if a hyperactive kid filmed then edited this piece as a class project.  At the close of it I wasn't quite certain what the point was; it isn't cynical enough to be political, it doesn't have the style necessary to make it an art film, the action isn't organized enough to make it a thriller.  What then?  Even the title is misleading, for although the lead character does go on a rampage, he never displays the required rage to make it feel justified (if only in his own mind).  The few circumstances that were brought up as evidence only suggested that he was having a really bad day.  Were all his days like this?As a whole, I found this movie curiously flat, displaying little emotion in thought or deed.  The biggest problem with this premise is that it demonstrated little we don't already know, while giving us characters so unrealized that we can't care about them or what happens to them.

87833,0790728354,A2C27IQUH9N1Z,10,14,2003-08-08,Yikes!  Ouch!,"What a mess!  Tolkien wrote 4 books -- The Hobbit and its sequel, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, made up of The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King -- which together tell the story of the resurfacing and the destruction of the One Ring of Power wielded by Middle Earth's evil nemesis, Sauron.  The animated trilogy consists of The Hobbit and two films that should divide the trilogy in half, Lord of the Rings and The Return of the King, though so much material and so many characters are written out that they bear scant resemblance to the source material.  To further complicate matters, The Hobbit and The Return of the King are produced and directed by Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass, the team that brought to television almost every holiday classic that concerns Santa Claus, Frosty, Rudolph or the Easter Bunny, while the second film, The Lord of the Rings, was directed by Raph Bakshi.  Confused yet?  It's important to remember these facts because, other than catering to your need to be comprehensive, you will most likely enjoy Bakshi's effort but should run from the other two as if hellhounds were on your tail.There is so much missing here (including dropping major characters that were in the second instament!) that you will never comprehend the story as written by Tolkien, and even more importantly, the ubiquitous songs are SO plentiful, SO saccharin and SO dated that you may damage your fingers trying to fast forward through them all. DVD extras are slim -- textual screens about Tolkien, Middle Earth and the cast &amp; crew that were on the previous disks.Voice talent is good:  John Huston narrates and plays Gandalf, Orson Bean repeats as Bilbo and Frodo, and Roddy McDowall comes on board as Sam.  Also, the animation of scenery and sets is very good, though weaker with the characters.  Great liberties are taken with Tolkien's material.  Great honking abysmal liberties.The word 'travesty' may be a bit strong, but not by much.  I am generally a forgiving Tolkien fan, and indeed I enjoyed the animated Lord of the Rings directed by Bakshi just fine, but this is drek by a team that treated Tolkien as if he were just Jack Frost with hobbits.  For example, when he runs to Gandalf to let him know that Denethor is attempting suicide, Pippin yells, &quot;He's gone loony I tell ya!&quot;  I don't think you have to be a Tolkien geek to think that's just wrongThis film may appeal to the very young or the very deaf, but for anyone who has read the books, do yourself a favor and steer clear of this song-filled pillage of the 20th century's greatest work of literature.",2.0,0.7142857142857143,2,2,0.0,neutral,0.9927,very positive,2003,8,8

Two dimensions of it were sufficient for me and I'm giving it one star for each dimension.  We have a story in which Brendan Fraser's scientist brother Max has disappeared and Trevor (Brendan Fraser)  is setting out to search for him.  But he gets saddled with having to care for Sean, Max's son played by Josh Hutcherson, who starts out as a bratty teenager and, of course, is initially p......d-off at the world.  (Actually, I was suspicious that Max simply couldn't stand Sean any longer and just took off).But, no. They follow Max's trail, aided by pretty guide, Hannah (Anita Briem) who causes Sean to drool a little, to the mouth of a volcano. They all begin to fall down a rabbit hole and finally land on a heap of sticks  and dry leaves -- no, I'm sorry, that's in Alice in Wonderland.  The volcano's hole turns into a water slide and they enter into a world that resembles a defective ride in a theme park.  They discover that Max had died there, of boredom no doubt, and encounter gigantic Venus flytraps (I  never saw any gigantic flies, though), dinosaurs stomping around and birds that glow in the dark.  They also get to ride in a mining car which turns into a roller-coaster that manages to jump across a ten foot gap and land on the tracks on the other side, the chances against that happening being about 30 billion to one.  At another point on their raft, a sharp-toothed fish is getting closer and closer to taking a bite out of Hannah's rump as Sean is watching and his lips seem to be saying ""Go for it, go for it!""Even though I was watching this movie in 2D, it was obvious that it was shot in 3D because actors are seen pointing out at the camera or shooting a yo-yo out of the frame at you or some other shenanigans, which simply stalls any continuity this film might have had.  By the time it's over Sean has transformed into a smiling puppy, licking his uncle's hand or whatever.The 1959 version of this story is a much superior film, having actors such as James Mason, Arlene Dahl and Pat Boone (Pat Boone??  Yes, it is Pat Boone), it's rather antique special effects notwithstanding.  Some shots were actually made in Carlsbad Caverns, I believe.  Now, you can't get more realistic than that.  The backgrounds in this new film look very much like painted scenery flats and the dinosaur chase scene with the characters running in the foreground on a treadmill is clearly a green screen process not particularly well executed.I had completely forgotten that Brendan Fraser had done a really nice acting job in the fine film ""Gods and Monsters.""

Okay, Arnold is not the greatest actor to ever grace the screen, but he usually makes great, suspend-disbelief-and-they-are-entertaining  movies.  Gabriel Byrne is a great actor and usually appears in good movies.  Kevin Pollack plays a side-kick as well as anyone and is good comic  relief.  Between the three of them, you would have hoped that one of them  would have read this script and said, &quot;Oh My God, this story is REALLY  BAD!&quot;The plot of this movie is predictable and so full of logical  holes that it makes one wonder if anyone actually wrote it or if they just  started filming a bunch of &quot;cool&quot; action and occult scenes and  thought putting it all together would make a good movie.  The Devil is  alternately brilliant and stupid.  Arnold somehow manages to outsmart the  Prince of Darkness and the New York Police Department, despite being an  alcoholic burn-out.  And, after watching this movie I am still confused as  to who Arnold and Kevin actually work for.  As for the number of the beast  being 999 instead of 666 and that being why Satan has to mate in 1999, I am  still confused as to what happened in the year 999.  Wouldn't that have  been the end of the thousand years they kept babling about in this movie?  Did the Devil run into an ancient version of Arnold and get his butt kicked  then, too?  And if so, why didn't he learn?In addition to the cast  already mentioned, this movie also has other good actors who should have  known better.  Robin Tunney (great in &quot;The Craft&quot;), Rod Stieger  (&quot;On the Waterfront&quot;), Anthony Fultz (&quot;For Love of the  Game&quot;) and CCH Pounder (&quot;Face Off&quot;) are all wasted in this  suprisingly bad movie.Don't get me wrong.  I can suspend disbelief with  the best of them, and I know movies are supposed to be entertainment and  not reality.  But, at some level, the movie must make sense and fill in the  blanks.  This movie seems to be just a vehicle for Arnold to kick Satan's  ass.  That is not a good enough reason to see this film.If you are a  true Arnie fan, you will see this anyway, despite the flaws (I did).

The jokes are bargain bin used and not very ambitious above bodily humor and cheap sex jokes.  All of these would be fine in my book if there were other types of jokes and they were more clever. They're not.  They stay the same and the same they are.  Over and over again for one hour and ten minutes.Also, I found the staging to be quite boring.  Literally, one puppet talks and then we cut to another and they talk.  Over and over and over again.  The film is very visually stale which is weird, despite it's low budget, they only had puppets that could do anything, and computer generated backgrounds that could be anything.  I've made really low budget films and they looked more visually stimulating than this.The puppet designs with the exception of the film's alien-like monster are all pretty dull.  There are no real characters but rather cliche'd characters from the 80's slasher movie character store.  Again, this would be all good if the filmmakers took a stand or a funny edge to them, but they don't.  The plot is a mix between Mad Monster Party, Ali?n, and House on Haunted Hill(either original or remake), so why not go more out of control.  This movie oddly keeps its characters and plot very stale as opposed to doing something crazy or wild like Meet the Feebles or even Team America.  Despite the wacky premise this film is very 'safe'.I appreciate what the film was trying to do, and I love the idea of the film using puppets, but this is no masterpiece unfortunately.  The dvd itself has only a couple of special features.  First we get two nixed creature desings that are neat, and then we get two audio commentaries, one of the director solo and the other of the director with his assistant.  I didn't listen to either due to me being bored and unsatisfied with the film.  If I had hated this film more, then it would've been neat to listen to the commentary kind of like the commentaries to Pearl Harbor and Armageddon.  Both of those movies are absolutely the worst of big Hollywood but the commentaries somehow make them both worth owning for their hilarity(sometimes from the director's sincerity and others because actors like Ben Affleck make fun of the film the whole running time).So, there you have it.  The gimmick of an R rated puppet film might get people to view this, but it's nowhere near as good as something like Meet the Feebles or Team America.  So, I say if you dig this or like the idea it's a better idea to rent the other two films mentioned and really see where and by how much these filmmakers missed the mark.  I mean, i fell asleep in about 45 minutes of a one hour and ten minute film!!!!  That's really boring!!!!!

The whole point of Blu-ray is increased picture and sound quality, isn't it (the ""increased durability"" claim means nothing to those of use who put their discs back in the cases when we're done with them)?

Feminists will run screaming at the blantant sexism (a feature common in the supposedly-enlightened future of the original Star Trek as well), and the bright pastel costumes might elicit a few chuckles today.  But the story remains strong, the effects are very well-done, and the film does succeed in creating a believable otherworld of the future.  And for those of us who came of age in the late 70's, there is a nostalgic charm (not to mention a briefly-nude Jenny Agutter) to keep things interesting.

Accept for maybe ""Joy Ride"" which has her in only about 30-40% of the film (great movie, by the way).Josh Hartnett is as fabulous an actor as he's always been, but in this movie, his down to earth, humble, quiet, sensitive character is made out to be nothing more than a jealous, corruptive, possessive boyfriend.If they expect us to believe that Sobieski's character would choose Klein's rich boy ""Kelley"" over Hartnett's small town ""Jasper"", they should have cast someone more lovable than Hartnett to take Klein's place. (Not an easy job..Good luck..) My rating stands. This is a movie worth missing.",2.0,0.6666666666666666,1,1,-0.5423,negative,0.9946,very positive,2002,5,3

Designed by the enigmatic Dr. Weir, Event Horizon was  the largest and most advanced spacecraft ever built (by man, anyway) when  it dissappeared on its maiden voyage.  Unknown by most, the ship was the  prototype for an experimental propulsion system using artificial gravity  wells, like those that surround black holes, to curve space.  This was  supposed to have the dual benefit of offering faster-than-light travel and  a leg-up on Albert Einstein.Unfortunately, much like the doomed  experimental starship, &quot;Event Horizon&quot; fails because it can't  escape its firmly 20th century roots.  The conscience-plagued Dr. Weir can  no more best Einstein when his prodigal spaceship reappears, than the  producers of this film can succeed any one of dozens of films they  ripped-off to make this movie.  &quot;Alien&quot; is only one of the more  obvious ingredients, along with &quot;Jaws&quot; (the invisible monster)  and &quot;Frankenstein&quot;.  The producers must have been asleep for the  past 20 years - the concept of humans running around like rats lost in the  dark maze of some mammoth and inhospitable spaceship - vast and  claustrophobic at the same time - has been done to death in movies,  straight-to-video, late-night cable and hyper-violent video games.  This is  the kind of movie begging for the &quot;Scream&quot; treatment - knowing,  self-reverential, yet self-parodying.  But &quot;Event Horizon&quot; takes  itself far too seriously - there are far too many British accents, giving  the show an arch &quot;Star Trek, nex Gen&quot; feel, while Larry Fishburne  is his usual dolemite self.  I like Fishburne, but his dead-serious  demeanor isn't served well here.  It's hard to get scared by a film that  remains so complacent in following other films - sqaundering possible plot  ideas.  Save for a horribly mutilated body, the ship is deserted.  It's not  so much that the script leaves the fate of the crew up to our imagination -  it doesn't seem to care a whit itself.  Why has it taken so long for the  ship to return?  Why was such an exotic technology tested on a manned  prototype rather than on an unmanned probe?  And why has the ship returned  to Neptune, rather than straight to Earth?  In films like the original  &quot;Alien&quot; and its countless rip-offs (remember  &quot;Outland&quot;?) the source of evil turns out to be man, defined by  greed or petty hate.  The mysterious evil populating &quot;Event  Horizon&quot; is pure evil, pronounces Dr. Weir.  That means it has no  form, no definition and above all, no charachter.  In that last respect,  the film and the spaceship are one.  Yet not even that can raise a chill.  Instead, rent any of the first two Alien movies, X-Tro-2 (why not?) or the  first American Werewolf movie.",2.0,0.5,2,5,0.4404,positive,-0.9874,very negative,2000,9,3

It was too long, slow, convoluted, and dark, and by dark I mean, visually dark and not interesting. The most beloved character, Jack Sparrow did not show up until the end of the first hour into the movie, and the scene of his first appearance was the best, the funniest, and sadly, the only scene in the movie that I liked. It showed Jack Sparrow trapped on the sea of sand in Davy Jones' Locker as the captain and the multiple members of the crew. The scene brought to memory the famous sequence from Being John Malcovich and it was the highest point of the movie. After that, Jack was moved to the periphery of the plot which was so incoherent that the film creators actually came up with the list of FAQ that baffled moviegoers had about the total mess of the final installment in the pirate trilogy. The list was included with the DVD. The original idea to make a movie based on the popular Walt Disney theme park ride proved to be great for two first movies that are funny and entertaining. The idea to create a philosophical-metaphysical-mythological epilogue to the series in the traditions of Lord of the Rings turned to be disastrous. The movie failed flat in all directions. I was either bored or laughed at the scenes that were not meant to be unintentionally funny. Even appearance of Keith Richards, Johnny Depp's inspiration for the role of Jack Sparrow, as Jack's father did not help much. First two films were exiting, had stunning special effects and awesome achievements in make up. The films breeze freely and move along with great pace. I liked the second movie very much because the way its creators prepared us for the third film was very clever.

1406276,B004G6009K,A1NMGCWGJ0BGVD,5,20,2011-05-17,Definitely NOT the best Disney Princess Movie,"I consider this movie to be the ""dumb blonde"" of the Disney princess saga: pretty to look at but lacking real substance. This movie had 90% positive reviews on Rottentomatoes.com, so it peaked my interest. I was sadly disappointed. This movie is what I like to call ""overrated animated"". I even took my 15-year old sister to see this movie, and even she hated it.The movie isn't SO bad that it should be missed, but it's a pretty standard movie. If it were anything else, it would be tolerable, but this is a DISNEY PRINCESS movie. This isn't just a pedigree; it's a genre of its own. Disney has always been the biggest name in princess movies because they have offered us many of the best. It's not just that they are prolific but also crafted. Tangled was just playing it safe and thus offered nothing new to the experience. In fact, one could say that it is a rehash of other Disney princess movies.The love interest is a thief, not a prince (Aladdin). The princess is taken away from her family at a young age not knowing she's a princess (Sleeping Beauty). The male and female leads hate each other first but wind up falling in love (Beauty and the Beast and any other romance). The story is incredibly cliche and predictable. You have a crucial misunderstanding that leads to ""the potential split"". You have thugs that ""don't dream of being mean"", much like in Shrek the Third. The one cliche that really ticked me off (as well as my sister) is the magical tear. I won't tell you who gets it, but you can guess. This deus ex machina has been done to death, and it's always silly and trite.Because this is a Disney princess movie, the filmmakers saw it fitting to write new songs for it. Every song is forgettable and unnecessary. There is no cardinal rule that EVERY DISNEY PRINCESS MOVIE NEEDS A SONG, but at least those that do have at least one memorable song. In fact, it doesn't contribute anything new to the princess genre. Let's look back: Snow White ate a poison apple. Cinderella had the glass slipper say she was the one. Sleeping Beauty had the spinning wheel put her to sleep. All had princes save them. Then came the Disney Renaissance. Aladdin had no prince. In fact, the movie may have made fun of it with the whole ""Prince Ali"" schtick. The Little Mermaid had a princess who is a mermaid falling in love with a human. Beauty and the Beast: the prince was an actual beast who falls in love with a village girl. Hell, the Princess and the Frog had the prince and princess turn into frogs and becoming human after marrying and kissing. What does Tangled offer? the hair? It's not symbolic enough.However, as I have said, Tangled isn't so bad that it should be missed. Despite its massive faults, it does have some positive qualities. The animation was pretty and creative. Disney knows how to mix and match the colors and make some really nice scenes. The scenes where Rapunzel and Flynn go to the kingdom look really good. The voice acting is pretty good despite the songs. Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi, and Donna Murphy all match their voices with their characters. There are a number of entertaining scenes, especially with the horse Maximus. That horse single-handedly (or hoovedly) stole the show every time it was on screen. If only it was on screen in every scene.Bottom line: Tangled isn't awful, but it doesn't help that everything good about it is offset by something bad. The voice acting is good, but the songs are forgettable. The animation is pretty, but the story is ungodly formulaic and cliche. There are a number of entertaining moments, but there aren't enough to make this movie entertaining on the whole. The fact that Disney focused more on making a successful princess movie and less on making a good one is really annoying. Tangled offers nothing that the other Disney princess movies haven't. It's not one of those Disney movies that will be remembered.",2.0,0.25,2,4,-0.17,neutral,0.9989,very positive,2011,5,17
1231923,B001QOGYFO,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,16,26,2009-09-10,Whiteout Movie Review from The Massie Twins,"While many have found graphic novels to be an excellent template for film adaptations, not all of them translate well to the big screen. Sadly, such is the case with Whiteout, which suffers in everything from the major (lackluster characters, crippling flashback quantities) to the minor (shoddy special effects, blatant continuity errors). As Kate Beckinsale trades fangs and skintight leather for parkas, she also leaves the entertainment value out in the cold. At least the suspense is handled with some care, though the harsh weather is far scarier than the ice-pick wielding villain.A troubled past finds U.S. Marshall Carrie Stetko (Kate Beckinsale) stationed at a remote scientific research facility in Antarctica. With only three days left before the base is plunged into a six-month-long darkness, Stetko is called upon to investigate a mysterious sighting. Uncovering the mutilated body of a scientist, she must race against time to solve the murder before she's trapped with a killer in the coldest, most isolated place in the world.The flashback doesn't have to be a painful storytelling technique, but Whiteout manages to horrifically abuse the tool. In poorly derived moments the film flashes back to the opening scene, to hazy, orange-colored character establishing memories and, in perhaps the most idiotic moment, to less than one minute ago. It's nothing short of staggeringly insulting to the audience. Carrie's history has almost no affect on her ability to catch the killer and is so simple that it could have been summed up in a routine conversation. Early on, the film even misuses fading to black, repeatedly creating a disorienting sense of missing footage.Movies like 30 Days of Night or The Thing have already, more impressively, utilized an abnormally cold setting and toy with the viewer's fears of extreme isolation, distrust and paranoia. In Whiteout, claustrophobia, asphyxiation and being buried alive are also introduced, along with the common, location-specific ""freezing to death."" What isn't so notable is the whiteout of the title, a snowstorm with 100 mph winds that prevent visibility beyond six inches. During the brief scenes dealing with the storm, the lack of sight is frequently anticlimactic, particularly when the blurry, fighting figures are nearly indistinguishable.Director Dominic Sena (Gone in 60 Seconds, Swordfish) must have been exceptionally proud of the special makeup effects department, donating generous amounts of screentime to disturbing shots of badly mutilated bodies. To make up for the grisly images is an immoderately gratuitous shower scene with Beckinsale that somehow produces no inappropriate nudity. Apparently the clarity inside a bathroom is as hindered as outside in the blizzard.- The Massie Twins",2.0,0.6153846153846154,3,2,0.0,neutral,-0.9912,very negative,2009,9,10

1432958,B004XZ99SM,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,3,5,2011-09-25,Not nearly as ambitious as I was hoping.,"Well, I first heard about this flick when I was flipping through last month's edition of Fangoria.  The review inside was on the mediocre side, but I thought for the right price I would give it a shot.  I did.  I was bored.  I fell asleep.  I restarted and finished the flick and wished I hadn't wasted the sixteen bucks!!!!!This is the ideal type of film for someone like me.  It's a love letter to the monster movies of the mid 80's.  Full of sex, nudity, graphic violence, rediculous plots....but done with felt puppets ala a really low rent version of The Muppets.  This should've been a time specific funny black movie on the level of Peter Jackson's brilliant Meet the Feebles.  It's not.  The jokes are bargain bin used and not very ambitious above bodily humor and cheap sex jokes.  All of these would be fine in my book if there were other types of jokes and they were more clever. They're not.  They stay the same and the same they are.  Over and over again for one hour and ten minutes.Also, I found the staging to be quite boring.  Literally, one puppet talks and then we cut to another and they talk.  Over and over and over again.  The film is very visually stale which is weird, despite it's low budget, they only had puppets that could do anything, and computer generated backgrounds that could be anything.  I've made really low budget films and they looked more visually stimulating than this.The puppet designs with the exception of the film's alien-like monster are all pretty dull.  There are no real characters but rather cliche'd characters from the 80's slasher movie character store.  Again, this would be all good if the filmmakers took a stand or a funny edge to them, but they don't.  The plot is a mix between Mad Monster Party, Ali?n, and House on Haunted Hill(either original or remake), so why not go more out of control.  This movie oddly keeps its characters and plot very stale as opposed to doing something crazy or wild like Meet the Feebles or even Team America.  Despite the wacky premise this film is very 'safe'.I appreciate what the film was trying to do, and I love the idea of the film using puppets, but this is no masterpiece unfortunately.  The dvd itself has only a couple of special features.  First we get two nixed creature desings that are neat, and then we get two audio commentaries, one of the director solo and the other of the director with his assistant.  I didn't listen to either due to me being bored and unsatisfied with the film.  If I had hated this film more, then it would've been neat to listen to the commentary kind of like the commentaries to Pearl Harbor and Armageddon.  Both of those movies are absolutely the worst of big Hollywood but the commentaries somehow make them both worth owning for their hilarity(sometimes from the director's sincerity and others because actors like Ben Affleck make fun of the film the whole running time).So, there you have it.  The gimmick of an R rated puppet film might get people to view this, but it's nowhere near as good as something like Meet the Feebles or Team America.  So, I say if you dig this or like the idea it's a better idea to rent the other two films mentioned and really see where and by how much these filmmakers missed the mark.  I mean, i fell asleep in about 45 minutes of a one hour and ten minute film!!!!  That's really boring!!!!!

The plot staggers this way and that, bouncing without pause from '60s comic book cheesiness (one of the primary foils is dubbed Professor Brian Oblivion) to insane, grotesque '80s gore effects (Woods's character sprouts a jumbo-sized vulva in his chest, then feeds it videotapes).

Also, Donald Pleasance returns as a scarred but still living Dr. Loomis.  However, that being said, this movie really fails as a competent sequel to Halloween 2.First, the movie fails to capture the Halloween theme as John Carpenter did in Halloween 1 & 2.  There is just something that Halloween 1 & 2 had that all of the sequels do not and it's not so much the acting as it is mood and/or motif.  I think John Carpenter had a lot to do with the genuine Halloween theme in the first two movies and he was not a major contributor to Halloween 4.The plot is centered around a young child named Jamie Lloyd, evidently the daughter of Laurie Strode, (Jamie Lee Curtis-Halloween) and she is tormented by a nightmare of Michael Myers coming after her.  However, these dreams prove to be prophetic in that Michael Myers is enraged when he discovers that he still has a living relative.  Myers discovers this while lying down in a comatose state in an abulance being transported to Smith's Grove.  In his anger, Myers sticks his thumb into the skull of one some doctor/paramedic...great scene.  Evidently, Myers has also put on quite a bit of muscle while he was in that coma for 10 years because this Myers is considerably larger than the original.Anyway, he returns to Haddonfield and racks up a pretty good amount of victims in his path including shoving a shotgun into the stomach of some teenaged girl.  The plot is very predictable as Myers kills his way to try and get a hold of his niece.  At any rate, the movie really doesn't deliver the goods like the original Halloween and Halloween II, but nevertheless, there are quite a few good kills in this movie and that's why I give 2.99 stars for a pretty good slasher flick, but I cannot justify giving this movie three stars as there is definitely nothing special about it. Halloween IV is pretty good as far as the slasher type flick is concerned, but it really fails to deliver the horror to the audience like Halloween and Halloween II.So, if you are in the mood for a slasher film, you might want to pick this up, but if you are in the mood for a really good Halloween movie, buy Halloween 1 and 2.",2.0,0.3333333333333333,5,2,-0.7711,very negative,0.4471,positive,2005,2,27

Stars James McAvory as Professor Charles Xavier, Michael Fassbender as Erik Lansherr aka Magneto, Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw, Jenifer Laurence as Mystique, Janurary Jones as Emma Frost, Rose Byrne as Dr Moia Taggert. Open the movie to Poland 1944 we have a young Erik Lansherr who was captured by Na  zi's they got his backstory right he's being used by this doctor we he kills his mother he gets uncontrollably angry the effects where he destroys the room look like Secret World Of Alex Mack effects that old show on Nickeloden but we get to fv  c  k ups  were introduced to a young Charles Xavier who hears something what could it be? Mystique & guess what? Young Xavier's like oh you can stay with us. Never did Xavier & Mystique live together or grow up together. Could just put the step brother plot in. But then again do we need another guy like Vinny Jones. We go to about 18 years later Erik is now an adult tracking Dr Schmit down for revenge. Xavier & Raven Mystique's real name there living together in Las Vegas where Xavier is going to College he has a head full of hair when he went completely bald by 18. Hels going around picking up chicks is he Gambit all of a sudden & he's saying groovy. He talks about mutations openly in a bar WTF!? You ge to see him drink from a bong looking thing were introduced to Moria MacTaggert of The CIA we also are introduced to the main villains The He  llfire Club  led by Sebastian Shaw couldn't 20th Century FUX used them for X Men 3. Well we get to the main plot The He  llfire group want take over the world what else! He wants this Colonel to put missiles in Turkey to start a war.Which leads into The Cuban Missile Crisis. MacTaggert convinces Xavier to help The CIA & they go to this Division called X. Oh yeah guess how Xavier & Erik meet he saves him from drowning cause Erik was going to kill Shaw in this particular scene. They round up other mutants to train to of course fight evil. Also Hugh Jackman makes a Cameo where they try to funny & failed but it was cool to see him. They to to be funny when they when Xavier & Erik capture Emma Frost. Hank McCoy is thrown in they totally screw him up where he made this cure & it backfires but the tranformation was over time not in 2 seconds & he's in love with Mystique. Beast is a tragic character. Let's get on with the grande finale more like grim finale. Magneto gets his hands on Shaw kills him despite Xavier telling him not to. It was cool how Magneto did it though. The Military fearing the mutants fire missile at them Magneto tries to use them against The Military Xavier prevents it we get a fight between them MacTaggert tries to stop it a bullet deflects off Magneto hits Xavier in the spine he's paralysed. Magneto is remorful so he leaves Mystique joins him. Erik goes by Magneto from now on he helps Emma Frost get out of the pokey. The problem with this movie is they try to mesh too many stories like they did in X3 & X Men Origins Wolverine. The story between Xavier Erik they were friends for years not 2 weeks & since when did Magneto take part in the 1st X Men. Just throwing Beast's story in with a 2 second tranformation. too many stories going on & a prequel was not needed I hate prequels more than remakes. James McAvory was forgettable Michael Fassbender wasn't any good as Magneto Patrick Stewart & Ian McKellan were better they had better interaction you believed those 2 were friends I'm sure that Michael Fassbender & James McAvory are good actors. Janurary Jones doesn't have much to do. Kevin Bacon was forgettable the animated Sebastian Shaw is better. The He  llfire Club should've been done in X3 they were filler anyway. I liked Rose Byrne & Jenifer Laurence they were the onlh likeable characters. I can't believe Rotten Tomatoes & IMDB have ranked above The 1st X Men movie  & X2  X2 was the best even X3 was better it tried to tell a story but it had a lot of good action it has it's problems though. Even X Men Origins Wolverine was better you atleast had a strong lead & some decent fights. Of couse who was the studio that released this movie 20th Century FUX. Tom Rothman needed to milk another franchise & looking at the money it made he was successful.

The didactic aspect of the film is so heavy-handed it takes you right out of the movie, out of the willing suspension of disbelief. It doesn't help that ""Elysium"" lacks the arresting characters, clever plotting, or wowee special effects that break science fiction films out beyond the genre's diehard fans.It's 2154 in a dystopic Los Angeles. LA is ugly and garbage-strewn, in a futuristic way. Almost everyone in LA is Hispanic or at least speaks Spanish. Max (Matt Damon), a bald and tattooed ex-con trying to go straight, is forced into taking on a high-risk crime for Spider (Wagner Moura), a crime lord. Max has to travel to Elysium, a space station where rich white Americans live in beauty and luxury, unlike the cursed denizens of earth, who are mostly Hispanic and live in garbage strewn slums and can't get adequate medical care. Elysium has med-beds. If you lie down on a med-bed, no matter what your ailment is, the med-bed will cure you.Spider is plotting to breach Elysium's security and take it over, thus making med-beds and Elysium's breathtaking beauty available to all. He faces formidable foes.Jodie Foster is the white, blonde Elysium antagonist. She is trying to protect Elysium from the Hispanic immigrants and sick people in search of health care who are attempting to enter. Kruger, played by Sharlto Copley, a South African actor, is her evil tool. There is no attempt to explain why someone with such a pronounced South African accent lives in LA. In any case, Copley's performance of an enthusiastic sadist is the best thing about the film.There is a lot of chasing. Men put on metallic costumes that give them special powers. There are your usual hyped up guns and there are also some knives and swords. A lot of this feels like expedient cheating, as it always does in fantasy movies. There are special devices that detect runaways. Max is able to elude these super smart devices by hiding under pigs. The movie never explains, as these movies never explain, the rules of such gadgetry. If a character needs to get away to advance the plot, some trick will help him to get away.I live in a non-futuristic, garbage-strewn slum. We have had liberal, Democratic government for generations. See Detroit. We've been hearing the same message for generations, the same message ""Elysium"" sends: ""It's us versus them. We are human; they are cold and cruel. They live lives of perfect bliss. Their health problems are all taken care of. They only way for us to achieve anything is to take what they have.""This message, even in a grade C sci-fi flick, is toxic. Liberals do not help us, the poor, by telling us that we have nothing of value in ourselves, that it is only through taking what the rich have that we can have lives of value. Poor people do not benefit by discounting what they have and living lives of passive, deluded envy, focusing on what the rich have rather than focusing on their own skills and blessings, and cultivating their own opportunities.If the Earthlings of ""Elysium"" succeeded in their goal, it wouldn't end there. It would end as the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, the Iranian Revolution and others ended: with terror, torture, rape, chaos, and ""meet the new boss; same as the old boss.""

Christmas is not universal, and Santa Claus (called many names in many countries) is less so.  This movie says that if you don't believe in a fat old man in a Coca-Cola suit that has a big factory with many many workers slaved in the North Pole you're out.  This kind of novo-fascism is not new for Robert Zemeckis: all of you remember that ode to stupidity and conformity that was ""Ggggump... Forrest Gump"" (I couldn't resist it, sorry).Since I was a child my parents told me that there is not such thing as Santa, and so I learned to judge my presents as a proof of the hard work (giving the proper economic conditions) that my parents did during the year (or at least that month).So, the movie.The animation is incredible (for 2004) but the faults in the characters' eyes and mouths make all the effort almost worthless.  Some rollercoaster moments must be great when seeying them in IMAX-3D (I suposse), but for most of us is a second-hand experience, when yout hink this would be great in such screen or another.  When the best sequence in all the film involves a train ticket blown by the wind (a motive by now in Zemeckis filmography) but none of the human characters is in it, you have a problem.

910271,B0009PLLN6,A1IBSQQHGCDUAN,2,5,2005-08-04,"Wanted to like it, but...","While I'm not joining the ranks of those who are jumping on Oliver Stone's ass as a has-been, ""Alexander"" is not a very good argument to the contrary.  The last really good movie I saw from Stone was probably ""U-Turn"", a great little sleeper if there ever was one.  ""Any Given Sunday"" had it's moments but tried way too hard to live up to the lifestyle insanity perpetrated by lesser gridiron flicks like ""The Program"" and ""Varsity Blues"".  ""Alexander"" is as tragically flawed as it's title character, a horrendous series of missteps that overlap so often that, for reviewing purposes, it's difficult to keep track of them all.I hate to be a Colin-basher, but like many I also didn't feel Farrell was convincing as the greatest conqueror the world had ever seen.  Sure, he pulled off impetuous, daring, and (dare I say it?) even gay with aplomb, but I believe the problem lies in the script.  Even Anthony Hopkins came off as a little hokey, but given the dialogue what can you expect?  Perhaps the worst was Angelina Jolie, a vaguely incestuous background presence for Alexander throughout the movie.  I really can't emphasize how badly the dialogue helped to tank the movie.  It veers wildly from hackneyed ""Ye gods why hast thou forsaken me?"" platitudes to sheerly incomprehensible wannabe Homeric/Shakespearean ranting.  You can certainly tell what it is that they're trying to get across but you can't make yourself believe that even a people in a completely different world than ours would talk to each other in this manner.  However, the dialogue is only part of the problem, and I think if we compare ""Alexander"" to Stone's other historical dramas we can get a little closer to the root of the problem.Regardless of the amount of conjecture involved in bringing the stories of both JFK and Richard Nixon to the screen, both of those movies worked for a reason:  an unflagging attention to detail.  The reason most Hollywood biopics feel formulaic (even the beloved ""Ray"" is largely guilty of this) is because the life of a man is complex and not always rational; some of the more jagged edges are often sanded down to make it less confusing for the average viewer.  However, in doing so you run the risk of making your movie seem less like watching someone's life play out on the screen and more like a typical Hollywood melodrama.  If ""JFK"" and ""Nixon"" are guilty of all manner of sins under the sun they are certainly not guilty of being ""Hollywood"".  These films worked because Oliver Stone took his time to really get inside the heads of these men and tell their tales, regardless of how many scenes or how much screen time it took to do so.But there's one big difference between those films and ""Alexander"": budget.  Yet the reason such an extravagant budget is required for this film but not the others is that neither JFK nor Nixon required huge action set pieces to tell their story.  For Alexander there is no other way.  From the age when most of us are having our first (legal) beer, Al was on the battlefield, carving his empire into the history books.  We also have another problem here:  the passage of time.  JFK and Nixon were both products of the 60s, and there is a wealth of detailed writing available on the intimacies of their psyches.  With Alexander we still have a great deal of chronicling of his exploits, but what we have mostly pertains to his military and political exploits, which leaves the mind of the man open to interpretation (ie. we know that up until the time of Philip's death Alexander was tutored by Aristotle - as famed a philosopher as ever Alexander would be a conqueror - but as to the substance of those teachings history is at a complete loss).  So it's just possible that Oliver Stone's strengths lay in other areas than psychoanalysis.  You can certainly tell a story without having any real insight into the human mind - pick up any mass market paperback for proof of that - and you can also film a pretty spiffy movie without being able to tell a story.  My guess is we're finding out that Stone's strengths reside somewhere between those two extremes, and if so, it's the choice of subject matter, scripts, etc. which will make or break his movies.  In the meantime let's not be too quick to make or break his legacy based on one or two misfires.",2.0,0.4,1,3,0.3612,positive,-0.9519,very negative,2005,8,4

This is especially irksome when the direction Boll was initially heading was too brief to establish anything but a few scattered images and an explosion; he might just as well have started the movie two days earlier!  Not that it would have made any difference as the timeline in this piece was suspect throughout.  Images were oft repeated, news reports kept chattering in the background announcing events that hadn't happened yet, were happening, or had just happened.

At the close of it I wasn't quite certain what the point was; it isn't cynical enough to be political, it doesn't have the style necessary to make it an art film, the action isn't organized enough to make it a thriller.  What then?  Even the title is misleading, for although the lead character does go on a rampage, he never displays the required rage to make it feel justified (if only in his own mind).  The few circumstances that were brought up as evidence only suggested that he was having a really bad day.  Were all his days like this?As a whole, I found this movie curiously flat, displaying little emotion in thought or deed.  The biggest problem with this premise is that it demonstrated little we don't already know, while giving us characters so unrealized that we can't care about them or what happens to them.  In the end, we're left with a strangely agitated rant that we can't trust is heartfelt by anyone involved.",2.0,0.5,11,1,0.4019,positive,-0.9934,very negative,2012,7,5

See the 1995 Ciaran Hinds version, instead.In this one - the haircuts are contemporary, the acting is moderately good but not memorable.

One of my favorite parts of the story is where Captain Wentworth writes out the letter while overhearing a conversation and unable to actually talk with Anne - and with a subtle motion, calls her attention to the note he has hidden - and her reaction.

1513381,B0068MNNOE,A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P,6,10,2012-03-21,Rather a Wasted Effort,"This movie isn't remotely accurate. But that's ok. It clearly isn't trying to be. Where it does fall down is that it isn't even believable. Nor is it thrilling. It's plodding and dull. I went in hoping that it would either be ridiculously bad or decently good, but it falls somewhere in the middle which makes it surprisingly unmemorable. It is however, at least original.What's quietly infuriating about this movie is Roland Emmerich's apparent desire to tear down the English. Shakespeare is a buffoon. That's to be expected from the very premise. But did they have to make Elizabeth an incompetent too? As a young woman she acts like a horny high schooler. She sleeps with everyone and has had several bastards which somehow nobody noticed despite her highly public position. She displays no evidence of nobility and simply acts like one of the girls. She is also under the control of William Cecil, the arch-villian of the piece. As an old woman she fares no better, suffering from dementia or at least deteriorating mentally. And do we really need tales of incest as well? At no point does she display any trace of class. In fact, the only character who does display this is De Vere, and he's the one that everyone keeps berating for not following his (ill-defined) role as a nobleman. The Cecils do display a bit of this, but they're so cartoonishly evil that it never really sticks. Between this, the scene of the British burning villagers to death inThe Patriot, and the unnecessary scene of Queen Elizabeth II walking her dogs onto the escape ship in2012I'm detecting a real pattern here.Emmerich really doesn't get Shakespeare at all. Everything that Shakespeare wrote served one fixed political purpose? It doesn't take a literary critic to see that that makes no sense. His use of the plays for political ends displays only the most superficial examples. For example, Polonius from Hamlet is dressed like William Cecil. Therefore his getting stabbed is a strike against Cecil. My only question is this: How? How does dressing a character up as a political figure count as making a political point? Polonius wasn't one of Shakespeare's arch-villains (Robert Cecil gets a much better one in Richard III), he was just a somewhat crafty man assisting the king. So what was the implication of it? There's nothing damaging to Cecil's reputation there, and the only reason that there is any connection made is because of the costuming. Which isn't anything to do with the written play at all. He could have dressed anyone up as Cecil and it would have had the same effect is what I gather. So that means the choice of ""Shakespeare's"" plays is unnecessary. They could have used anyone. And watching a play wherein the villain looks like a famous figure is reliably going to provoke a riot calling for his overthrow? Really? How dumb does he think people are? If somebody digitally placed Obama's head on Hitler's body could we expect the same reaction here?A really confusing aspect of this film is its tendency to switch between modern and Elizabethan English at the drop of a hat and for no reason. It's like they remember to match the tone of the plays only occasionally and then ad lib the rest. Another confusing feature is how they keep switching back and forth in time. The only way to keep track is to spot the younger actors playing the part. Not always easy to tell in all those elaborate costumes.So the good points: Rhys Ifans is excellent as Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford. He's pretty much the only character who manages to be interesting and sympathetic. While they never give him any motivation or insight (being a genius is considered enough of an explanation apparently) he does at least come off well. Also coming off pretty well (or at least entertaining) is Rafe Spall as Shakespeare. He's a pathetic, greedy little man and it is immensely fun. Apart from them and a brief introduction by Derek Jacobi (performing the same role he did better in Henry V) the acting in this film is uniformly horrible. The look of the city is superb and manages to capture a good deal of the griminess that most films manage to leave out while still maintaining a sense of scale. It was very nice to see London Bridge rendered in beautiful CGI. Also, some of the staging (although stolen from better films) wasn't too bad. But apart from these fairly minor points the movie has nothing to offer. You're better off seeingShakespeare in Loveor one of the many films based off his plays. This one offers a fresh idea, but cannot decide whether it is a realistic drama or an over-the-top spectacle. Either one would be fine, but this film never commits.",2.0,0.6,1,2,-0.4939,negative,0.9729,very positive,2012,3,21

1473043,B005LAIHR2,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,0,2,2013-01-15,Fails to be the tribute it aims to be,"This review is coming from a 21 year old who is huge fan of 80's music, fashion and culture that borders on the obsession. After hearing about the Rock of Ages film project I feared it would be a big Hollywood production that would end up as a B film as best and wouldn't pay proper tribute to the 1980's, the music and the scene it attempts to tribute. This is more of less exactly what happened. There are some nice moments and entertaining parts, and some versions of the songs are actually decent but it fails to be a modern day Grease or whatever it was that they attempted it to be. It's as if they didn't know what they wanted to do with this except have some popular 80's tune, a bit of a throwback to the fashion of the era and try to hold it together with songs, Grease and some of the other musicals I've seen had heart.Rock of Ages is set in L.A. on the Sunset Strip in 1987, to start it has the time and setting properly set. The look and atmosphere is just about right which are sure to bring back memories. The song selection is for the most part very good and much of what you would expect musically wise: ""Don't Stop Believin'"" (Journey) ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" (Bon Jovi), ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"" (Def Leppard), 'Hit Me With Your Best Shot' (Pat Benatar), ""I Wanna Rock"" (Twisted Sister), ""Sister Christian"" (Night Ranger) and many others.Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx is one of the few actual things that does work for Rock of Ages. His performances and duets were the more enjoyable ones due to his given Rockstar character and his portrayal of Stacee. Cruise's character comes off as a true rockstar of the 80's and it looks like he based his performance on the rockers of the era (Axl Rose mostly in terms of style and fashion).  It's not amazing acting but he is likeable as the sleazy rockstar. I like Russel Brand usually but even if he almost always looks like and carries a rockstar vibe was lame in this film. His character's interactions with his bar owner friend are homoerotic and almost uncomfortable to watch. Julianne Hall and Diego Boneta as and Sherrie and Drew the two stars are likeable and well cast and Rock of Ages really revolves around their story.I started watching Rock of Ages with little hope of it actually good, but with an open mind and expecting at least to be entertained. It more or less succeed at being a 'good' film in my opinion and misses in some areas I thought. To me the big problem with Rock of Ages is that it doesn't tell a story to which you can relate or get into land as a musical, that's not good. I love the 80's but my friends who saw this couldn't get why or what I like about the decade and it does't make it look cool and I don't think it would make any audience want to live them just for one day. It somehow misses and doesn't connect with it's audience because it's too self-obsessed with almost being a parody to create genuine feelings that can be related to, it just doesn't work all that well. It is fun and some of it is entertaining but it doesn't come off anywhere near great.Overall, it comes off as karaoke with some interesting versions and some rather poor ones and what seemed like a potentially good story was thrown away. It's a big production with big names to appeal to the general public but it fails to pay proper tribute to the 1980's which was the main goal unfortunately. I'm sure there was a market for this film just as I'm sure there are quite a few 80's enthusiast and nostalgics who are downright embarrassed by Rock of Ages. It lacks heart an substance and was very Glee-like. Towards the end it was getting a little to painful to watch for this viewer as it was getting long. I like that they wanted to pay homage to the 80's and the music but the story wasn't anywhere near captivating and although some of the musical numbers are fun and entertaining, Rock of Ages falls short of what it hopes to be. It doesn't translate to film so well. 2.5 out of 5.P.S. there's a great bonus feature 'Legends of the Strip' mini documentary of the era with major rock artists that lived the 80's and tell tales and stories about the Sunset Strip, the music and the fashion. that's worth watching",2.0,0.0,1,4,-0.4215,negative,0.9989,very positive,2013,1,15

Stars James McAvory as Professor Charles Xavier, Michael Fassbender as Erik Lansherr aka Magneto, Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw, Jenifer Laurence as Mystique, Janurary Jones as Emma Frost, Rose Byrne as Dr Moia Taggert. Open the movie to Poland 1944 we have a young Erik Lansherr who was captured by Na  zi's they got his backstory right he's being used by this doctor we he kills his mother he gets uncontrollably angry the effects where he destroys the room look like Secret World Of Alex Mack effects that old show on Nickeloden but we get to fv  c  k ups  were introduced to a young Charles Xavier who hears something what could it be? Mystique & guess what? Young Xavier's like oh you can stay with us. Never did Xavier & Mystique live together or grow up together. Could just put the step brother plot in. But then again do we need another guy like Vinny Jones. We go to about 18 years later Erik is now an adult tracking Dr Schmit down for revenge. Xavier & Raven Mystique's real name there living together in Las Vegas where Xavier is going to College he has a head full of hair when he went completely bald by 18. Hels going around picking up chicks is he Gambit all of a sudden & he's saying groovy. He talks about mutations openly in a bar WTF!? You ge to see him drink from a bong looking thing were introduced to Moria MacTaggert of The CIA we also are introduced to the main villains The He  llfire Club  led by Sebastian Shaw couldn't 20th Century FUX used them for X Men 3. Well we get to the main plot The He  llfire group want take over the world what else! He wants this Colonel to put missiles in Turkey to start a war.Which leads into The Cuban Missile Crisis. MacTaggert convinces Xavier to help The CIA & they go to this Division called X. Oh yeah guess how Xavier & Erik meet he saves him from drowning cause Erik was going to kill Shaw in this particular scene. They round up other mutants to train to of course fight evil. Also Hugh Jackman makes a Cameo where they try to funny & failed but it was cool to see him. They to to be funny when they when Xavier & Erik capture Emma Frost. Hank McCoy is thrown in they totally screw him up where he made this cure & it backfires but the tranformation was over time not in 2 seconds & he's in love with Mystique. Beast is a tragic character. Let's get on with the grande finale more like grim finale. Magneto gets his hands on Shaw kills him despite Xavier telling him not to. It was cool how Magneto did it though. The Military fearing the mutants fire missile at them Magneto tries to use them against The Military Xavier prevents it we get a fight between them MacTaggert tries to stop it a bullet deflects off Magneto hits Xavier in the spine he's paralysed. Magneto is remorful so he leaves Mystique joins him. Erik goes by Magneto from now on he helps Emma Frost get out of the pokey. The problem with this movie is they try to mesh too many stories like they did in X3 & X Men Origins Wolverine. The story between Xavier Erik they were friends for years not 2 weeks & since when did Magneto take part in the 1st X Men. Just throwing Beast's story in with a 2 second tranformation. too many stories going on & a prequel was not needed I hate prequels more than remakes. James McAvory was forgettable Michael Fassbender wasn't any good as Magneto Patrick Stewart & Ian McKellan were better they had better interaction you believed those 2 were friends I'm sure that Michael Fassbender & James McAvory are good actors. Janurary Jones doesn't have much to do. Kevin Bacon was forgettable the animated Sebastian Shaw is better. The He  llfire Club should've been done in X3 they were filler anyway. I liked Rose Byrne & Jenifer Laurence they were the onlh likeable characters. I can't believe Rotten Tomatoes & IMDB have ranked above The 1st X Men movie  & X2  X2 was the best even X3 was better it tried to tell a story but it had a lot of good action it has it's problems though. Even X Men Origins Wolverine was better you atleast had a strong lead & some decent fights. Of couse who was the studio that released this movie 20th Century FUX. Tom Rothman needed to milk another franchise & looking at the money it made he was successful.

Of course it may ultimately be a story worth filming, if only for us to be yet again astonished at what else the human psyche is capable of inflicting on those who least deserve it.  And naturally, such a bizarre formula will find it's audience, as schlock movies do as well.But, for me, there are just too many loose ends; improbable and melo-dramatic solutions to the story to deserve the accolades that are being showered upon it for some or other inexplicable reason.  The film lacks finesse and understanding and approaches its subject matter pandering to an unintelligent audience, which is hooked on matter that may be likened to fast food.

633423,B00005JNP1,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,10,43,2005-03-25,The Moose Hole - 'Million Dollar' Bust,"Could this be the year? That appears to be the very question on everyone's mind this Oscar season and the answer always depends on who you are asking. Based on the fans of The Aviator, they believe co-heartedly that if the Boston Red Sox could lift their once-ancient curse then there is still hope for Martin Scorsese in the Best Director category. For Million Dollar Baby, The Aviator's only true competition (Sorry Sideways), Clint Eastwood could prove to be back in contention form. Though many critics praised last year's contender, Mystic River, it had nothing on the existential strength that was The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. But, seeing as how that was the last film in the trilogy, the field for Best Picture is left wide-open, but truthfully only two face a bout-to-bout battle for the prize. Do you feel lucky, punk?Frankie Dunn, quite possibly one of the best boxing trainers in the country, is not the type of person who will ever get close to anyone again, especially after his daughter wants nothing to do with him, returning all of his letters to her, and his champion-in-training abandon him for a chance at the big time. Then one day, a typical white-trash diner waitress named Maggie Fitzgerald walks into his gym and asks to be trained to fight in the ring. Dunn quickly refuses, stating being ""tough is not enough"". Eventually, after witnessing Maggie's sheer determination in her training, Frankie takes her on based on two conditions - that she listens to everything he says and that she does not ask any questions. Though begrudgingly brought together by fate, the two begin to form a solid father/daughter-like relationship together, each sharing a common bond with one another based on family abandonment lodged in their pasts. This relationship will be tested to its limits by an event none of them ever expected or ever wanted to face. The story for Million Dollar Baby is darn near impossible to define in precise terms. What starts out as not only an engaging and exhilarating boxing drama but also an emotionally stirring divulgence into the belief of second chances quickly, and all too suddenly, shifts gears into a pure spear-headed propagandist piece. Why did things have to go so disturbingly wrong? The first two-thirds of the film showcased some of the most heart-warming, breathtaking, and all-out inspirational boxing sequences this side of Raging Bull. Truly an Oscar tour-de-force from everyone involved. And then they had to go about and kill it, so to speak, with a conclusion that felt as if someone had side-checked the audience into a brick wall.Clint Eastwood, in the role of the hard-shelled - are not all his characters that way - boxing trainer Frankie Dunn, was mainly nominated for his performance due to his marquee name - Paul Giamatti deserved it more - but the character itself is too wild for even the most Hollywood of clich&eacute;s. It is both an appalling and disturbing sight to see critics and the public alike applaud a performance in which Eastwood comes in at the end of the film through the hospital wing like the ""Angel of Death"" to secretly kill a woman he raised as if she were his own daughter. Perhaps audience members were given the wrong perception on the real daughter that left him. Maybe she was the only one with the true sense about her. If you knew your father would end up doing what he did to Maggie, would you not leave him? The parish priest asks Frankie one day after exiting the morning service, ""Why do you bother coming to church?"", or something to that affect. This honestly has to be the most thought provoking question in the entire film after witnessing how he goes against practically every Christian teaching on the subject of valuing the human life in the book, specifically The Bible. Hilary Swank is obviously on tap to receive the Oscar for Best Actress this year at the Academy Awards for her performance as boxer in training Maggie Fitzgerald, but does she truly deserve the honor or rather is there a serious lack of true competition against her? Should she receive kudos for training excruciatingly hard for the role and floating gracefully around the boxing ring like a true woman champion? Sure, she deserves every bit of it. Should she be the one to receive two golden statuettes in such a short period of time while taking lead roles in such trash as The Core and The Gift? Not so sure about that one. Maggie also acts as a rather crude insult toward anyone from the South - in fact her entire family could actually be brought into this discussion while we are at it. In Million Dollar Baby, every individual who happens to be from the southern region of the country is portrayed as either a know-nothing country bumpkin, complete with inbred appearance, or a worthless piece of white trash that will never amount to anything in this world. This is the typical clich&eacute; of both Hollywood and the liberal establishment in general. They love it so much it kills them to see over and over again - if only.Overall, Michael Moore occultists, more accurately those left who have yet to buck up the nerve to take their Kool-Aid following the reelection of Bush-Hitler, can at most find some consolation in the fact that at least some left-wing propagandist piece could walk away with a golden statuette on Oscar night, though seeing as how it is not from the imagination of the grand-master himself it may mean little to them. Already the fringe leftists have a pathetic excuse for their bumbling actions claiming, ""But at least Frankie was not cruel enough to do the deed while she was sleeping. Was it not the most touching moment when they said their good-byes before the end?"" Sure, if your name is Michael Schiavo, master of illusions, willing to romanticize the concept cold-blooded murder in order to knock off your wife and collect on her life insurance  in which to live happily ever after with your mistress and your two children. Straight out, euthanasia is nothing more then a gussied up word used by liberal elitists to cover-up the act of cold-blooded murder, accepted only by the slack-jawed idiots churned out by donkey universities who can not put two-and-two together.""But"", they stutter ""should we truly allow those who are confined to wheelchairs, unable to move a single limb, live out the rest of their purposeless lives in utter agony?"" Following that sense of logic, Christopher Reeve, in spite of whatever Brother John Edwards may want you to think, should have been put of his damn misery years before he actually died. In spite of how thickheaded the liberal establishment is, this should not be as complex an issue as it has been made out to be. First and foremost, your life does not solely belong to you; it belongs to the creator as well. God created everyone specifically in his image with a purpose in this life, though we may not know what that will be at the time, and he will take you from this world when he feels it is your determined time. You have neither the privilege nor the authority to dictate when and where you want to die. In spite of what the radical liberals may tell you otherwise, man is not higher up within the chain-of-command then God himself. Anything to the contrary is absolute sacrilege. And secondly, concerning the level of governmental authority over this issue, the 1997 Supreme Court case, Washington v. Glucksberg and Vacco v. Quill, in which the nine justices were unanimous in their decision, determined that the United States Constitution did not allow the practice of assisted suicide and declared that it should continue to be outlawed in this country. In addition to that, Baby promotes the ideal that if you are able to reach the zenith of your life, the one true shot at the big time, that even if you fail doing so you will have achieved your purpose in this world and you may therefore die with a sense of dignity having nothing left to live for. Perhaps that one could be explained more clearly to Mr. Eastwood, whether he actually wins on the big night or not, by taking a quick pot-shot to his head on his way to the limo. After all, does it not make sense for him to practice what he preaches? Million Dollar Baby is positively insulting, bordering on the line of being flat-out slanderous, both to Catholicism and the respect for quality of life in general. There should be no respect left for Clint Eastwood, either in the realm of films or politics, after this travesty.Believe what you want, but the liberals of this country view the cruel methods of abortion and euthanasia (assisted suicide) as the justifiable means in which to purge themselves of the responsibility they have toward another human life. If that is the direction in which we as a collective national society are heading towards in terms of our moral values then we are all royally screwed, both within this life and the next.",2.0,0.2325581395348837,1,4,0.0,neutral,0.989,very positive,2005,3,25
287434,630197820X,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,3,8,2005-03-06,The Weak Spot in the Rocky Series,"While I found Rocky III an entertaining movie, I felt this was the film that began the decline of the Rocky series.  For one thing, it lost its Philadelphia focus.  There were no scenes filmed in Philadelphia.  Rocky was no longer a down and out, Philadelphia guy - but now a polished champion who had his face fixed up.  However, I think the biggest problem with Rocky III is that Rocky was beginning to get transformed into a quasi-Superhero.  He was going up against the likes of Thunderlips and Clubber Lang.  In both of these opponents, Stallone would over-choreograph the fight sequences and created some non-realistic fight scenes.  When Rocky IV was released, I was really hoping that Stallone would find a way to ""go back to basics"" with the Rocky series.  Instead, Stallone deviates even further from the basics and creates what I feel is the weakest of all of the Rocky movies.The story goes like this.  At the end of Rocky III, Apollo Creed told Rocky he owed him a favor.  That favor would turn out to be that Rocky would help Apollo launch a comeback.  It turns out there is a up and coming Russian fighter named Ivan Drago who is a complete physical specimen.  Apollo feels he can beat the Russian and agrees to fight him in an exhibition match.  The exhibition match turns out to be deadly - Apollo is beaten badly by Drago and dies.  Rocky is now depressed and feels he now must avenge Apollo's death in the ring.  Adrian is completely against the match, but Rocky forges ahead and agrees to fight Drago in Moscow.  Rocky will take Paulie and Apollo's trainer Tony to Siberia to train in the harshest and primitive conditions.  This contrasts to the high tech environment that Drago is fighting in.  This leads to the movie's finale which is a bloody confrontation in the ring between Rocky and Drago pitting East vs. West.There are a lot of problems with this movie.  For starters, in the mid 1980s, Sylvester Stallone seemed to have this obsession with going up against the Russians.  He had used this theme in his ""Rambo"" movies and now was trying to create the same theme in the Rocky movies - this just didn't belong in the series.  I also didn't like the fact how (most of the movie), the Russians were portrayed as the bad guys.  Another problem is that the storyline almost reads like a storyline in a Wrestling Pay-Per View event:  Just substitute Apollo, Rocky, and Drago as Wrestlers - Drago does something bad to Apollo,  Rocky now must extract revenge in the squared circle against Drago.Another thing that I don't like is that Apollo had to die in this movie.  By having Apollo die, another core character to the Rocky series was now gone.  In Rocky III, I felt it was a bad decision to kill off one of the more popular characters - Mickey.  Mickey provided some of the great moments in the first two Rocky movies.  While I don't think Apollo was nearly as popular as Mickey, Apollo's character was re-invented in Rocky III.  Apollo went from the villain in Rocky I/II to good guy in Rocky III.  This allowed Apollo's character to be redefined and go in new directions.  Was it really necessary to have Apollo die?The first three Rocky movies did a great job at developing the characters - especially of Rocky, Adrian, Paulie, and Apollo.  For this movie, there is virtually no character development whatsoever.  Adrian, who had grown from shy girl to strong woman in the first three movies basically doesn't change much in terms of her strength in this movie.  Paulie actually began to regress in Rocky III.  After Paulie got arrested in Rocky III, he was basically relegated to the role of cantankerous curmudgeron.  In Rocky IV, he basiclaly maintains this role.  I did find the scenes between Paulie and the Robot and Paulie in Siberia amusing, but there isn't much to growing Paulie's character.  One thing Paulie does continue to do is maintain a great sense of humor.There are some new characters introduced - namely Drago, his wife Ludmilla (played by Stallone's real-life wife at the time, Brigitte Nielson), and their ""promoter"" Nicoli Koloff. There is little in providing good insight into these characters.  Ludmilla acts merely as a ""spokesperson"" for Drago throughout the movie.  We don't see much interaction between Drago or Ludmilla and don't get a chance to see how the fight with Rocky is affecting the two as a couple.  I also felt that Nicoli's character could have been so much more.  Michael Pataki, who played Nicoli is an actor who has been around for a while.  Pataki might best remembered for his role as ""Count Mallachi"" in the Demolition Derby on the Pinky Tuscadero episodes on ""Happy Days"".  Pataki had done a great job in those episodes as well as in many other acting roles.  However, in ""Rocky IV"" it just seems like they never tapped Pataki's potentialAnother overall problem is the use of the music.  In Rocky III, Stallone had moved away from the passionate music of Bill Conti toward more of pop music (namely Survivor).  In Rocky IV, while there is no Bill Conti and he does continue the pop music trend, he does introduce us to a talented musician named Vince DiCola - who provides some passionate music.  The problem is that the music isn't used to compliment the movie.  Instead many of the scenes of the movie read more like a glorified music video instead of a story.  The music is good, but it could have complimented the story better.While this movie does entertain, I think this is the weakest entry in the Rocky Series.  Even the highly criticized Rocky V built up the characters and used the music much more effectively.

The whole point of Blu-ray is increased picture and sound quality, isn't it (the ""increased durability"" claim means nothing to those of use who put their discs back in the cases when we're done with them)?  The really frustrating thing about this disc is that some scenes--especially those involving a lot of color--practically jump off the screen.  But often the picture becomes horribly grainy, which probably looks bad on ANY t.v., but looks absolutely atrocious on my 52"" HDTV.Even the extras are lacking.  All you get is a commentary track, theatrical trailer, and a vintage featurette.  With the available space on a Blu-ray disc, plus the fact that there are additional materials on the film out there (as seen in the laserdisc release), the whole package seems nothing more that a rehash of the previous DVD release.For the unintiated, the film itself is a minor classic, although certain aspects haven't aged well.  Feminists will run screaming at the blantant sexism (a feature common in the supposedly-enlightened future of the original Star Trek as well), and the bright pastel costumes might elicit a few chuckles today.  But the story remains strong, the effects are very well-done, and the film does succeed in creating a believable otherworld of the future.  And for those of us who came of age in the late 70's, there is a nostalgic charm (not to mention a briefly-nude Jenny Agutter) to keep things interesting.

I ended up flipping through it, putting it aside, and watching the movie instead.This movie sucks all intelligence out of you, drains your faith in modern acting, and yet makes you want to watch it all because it's ""so bad, it's good"". The monotonous delivery of Bella's lines can make one crack up at even the most dramatic scenes; Edward resembles a manic-depressive pedophile whenever he's anywhere near Bella; and Taylor Lautner's Jacob, as little as he appears, is one of the only good performances in the film (along with, occasionally, Charlie).

As if the image weren't bad enough, now sparkles have noises.Then, suddenly, even though Edward is rude, condescending, brooding, and moping ninety percent of the time, Bella falls ""in love"" with him.

Tolkien wrote 4 books -- The Hobbit and its sequel, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, made up of The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King -- which together tell the story of the resurfacing and the destruction of the One Ring of Power wielded by Middle Earth's evil nemesis, Sauron.  The animated trilogy consists of The Hobbit and two films that should divide the trilogy in half, Lord of the Rings and The Return of the King, though so much material and so many characters are written out that they bear scant resemblance to the source material.  To further complicate matters, The Hobbit and The Return of the King are produced and directed by Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass, the team that brought to television almost every holiday classic that concerns Santa Claus, Frosty, Rudolph or the Easter Bunny, while the second film, The Lord of the Rings, was directed by Raph Bakshi.  Confused yet?  It's important to remember these facts because, other than catering to your need to be comprehensive, you will most likely enjoy Bakshi's effort but should run from the other two as if hellhounds were on your tail.There is so much missing here (including dropping major characters that were in the second instament!) that you will never comprehend the story as written by Tolkien, and even more importantly, the ubiquitous songs are SO plentiful, SO saccharin and SO dated that you may damage your fingers trying to fast forward through them all. DVD extras are slim -- textual screens about Tolkien, Middle Earth and the cast &amp; crew that were on the previous disks.Voice talent is good:  John Huston narrates and plays Gandalf, Orson Bean repeats as Bilbo and Frodo, and Roddy McDowall comes on board as Sam.  Also, the animation of scenery and sets is very good, though weaker with the characters.  Great liberties are taken with Tolkien's material.  Great honking abysmal liberties.The word 'travesty' may be a bit strong, but not by much.  I am generally a forgiving Tolkien fan, and indeed I enjoyed the animated Lord of the Rings directed by Bakshi just fine, but this is drek by a team that treated Tolkien as if he were just Jack Frost with hobbits.  For example, when he runs to Gandalf to let him know that Denethor is attempting suicide, Pippin yells, &quot;He's gone loony I tell ya!&quot;  I don't think you have to be a Tolkien geek to think that's just wrongThis film may appeal to the very young or the very deaf, but for anyone who has read the books, do yourself a favor and steer clear of this song-filled pillage of the 20th century's greatest work of literature.",2.0,0.7142857142857143,2,2,0.0,neutral,0.9927,very positive,2003,8,8

129664,0792157869,A2I4VTPKGSQZ75,3,16,2008-05-27,"Indiana Jones, Monty Python and the holy handgrenade of Antioch","For some reason, unbeknownst to me, quite a few people (and reviewers) dismissed the excellent ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" (also reviewed) as the worst sequel in the original 80's Indy series and some said it was just simply a bad film...full stop. They derided the film so much that I wondered if they had actually seen it at all, so unjust was the ""outrage"" against the episode. Obviously, the fact that ""Temple of Doom"" was following the truly wonderful ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (the only really great film of the 4) had a negative effect on how some were going to view the first sequel in the series, as no matter how hard Lucas and Spielberg et al tried they couldn't hope to top the incredible impact that ""Raiders"" had on the public.But unfortunately, it seems that the producers of the Indy series abandoned their own judgment and bent over backwards in an attempt to eliminate the darker elements of ""Temple of Doom"" and replace it with lashings of incredibly stupid and inane comedy for the third installment, ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"".So vehement were the producers of ""Last Crusade"" to replace serious content with appalling idiocy, they were willing to litter the movie with slapstick nonsense that destroyed the overall film.Of course, that doesn't mean that the film is a complete write off in every department. The basic story is OK (but only just) and sees our hero following in his fathers obsessive quest for the famed cup of Christ, or the Holy Grail. The essential plot elements are all there and includes the usual Indy staples of multiple locations, deadly traps and spectacular supernatural McGuffin. Even the Germans were forced back into their nazi uniforms to don their traditional Hollywood caricature as the badguys; Which, in my opinion was a bit tired and un-necessary. There are plenty of bad folk around and their presentation here is far, far inferior than their turn in ""Raiders"".Most in the movies favor, and the only reason this film gets an extra star, is the inclusion of Sean Connery as Indy's dad. It's a good plot device to hang the kinda weak central plot onto and Connery's performance as the bungling Old Man of Henry Jones Jr is quite delightful and he has some great lines too...""We named the dog Indiana"".The shared screen time of Ford and Connery generally works well and they pair of them seemed to be having a good time in their roles.Another mention should go to Irish actress Alison Doody, as the obligatory squeeze (with a twist) and Denholm Elliott who reprises his charming role as Marcus Brody, dean of Indy's college in America. Unfortunately, it was to be for the last time.Also of note, is a floppy haired River Phoenix as a young Indiana in the movies brilliant opening sequence.Unfortunately, after the opening is complete, the film starts to go rapidly downhill until it naturally reaches it's ridiculously absurd climax, by which time my suspension of disbelief had had enough and Mr Cynicism had stepped in.But even the rapidly disintegrating story would have been bearable if Spielberg and Lucas had refrained from carelessly dropping the incredibly unfunny attempts at ""humour"" through the film. Sure, the two preceding efforts had liberal amounts of humour sprinkled within it's opening and ending credits, but it remained subtle and never interfered with the overall product or the ""seriousness"" of the piece. In ""Raiders"" Indy shoots the sword wielding foe with his revolver, instead of fighting him with a sword and in ""Temple of Doom"" he tries it again, but this time his gun has been missing since the opening sequence. These humourous efforts are fine and funny and what's more they are limited to reality. They don't break down the walls of reality and destroy the suspense or action of a given scene.Whereas the ""humour"" in the ""Last Crusade"" is so heavy handed that it completely ruins a scene. For instance, when Indy breaks his way through a library floor in Venice to get to a secret chamber, the noise he naturally makes breaking the floor is mistaken by a librarian for the noise he makes while he is stamping overdue books. Now, this may be fine in a Monty Python movie, but in a film such as an Indy adventure, it is just stupid. There's no other words for it. It ruins the suspense of the scene.Likewise the ""No Ticket"" scene in the Zeppelin and the ridiculous Berlin book burning scene where Indy meets Hitler, coupled with the scene where the BF108 pilot sheers his wings off and continues traveling down a tunnel beside a car containing the Jones boys go a long way towards tearing apart any suspension of disbelief that's required equipment for watching a film of this sort. It's unbelievably groan making, destroys the suspense and danger and it's difficult to imagine anyone finding it enjoyable.At it's conclusion ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" has long since revealed itself another 'could have been' film. It could have been great, but it's let down terribly by the decision to dilute the overall effect with mind numbing idiocy and it kills any excitement with dreadful foot stamping comedy that even a Will Ferrell movie would scoff at.",2.0,0.1875,1,2,0.0,neutral,-0.9956,very negative,2008,5,27

It's a pretty tired old tale if you ask me.Ryan wants to be an actor, but he can't act. His ex-bf, Daniel shows up, and Ryan lets him back into his life. Even though he knows Daniel is still using drugs, still having random, unprotected sex, and still stealing and lying to support his habit. Even though he says Daniel smells bad, yet defiantly refuses to use deodorant. But regardless of Daniel's wretched body odour, Ryan can't stop having sex with Daniel long enough to throw him out. So Ryan begins a downward spiral. First losing his acting job. Then by participating in Daniel's promiscuity. And finally by doing drugs with one of Daniel's random tricks. In the last scene he appears to have died of an overdose.I wish I could say something nice about this film. But it suffers from a lack of direction. By that I mean, the director wasn't doing his job. Camera work was shaky and out of focus. Actors fumbled and stumbled over badly written lines. And it's really hard to say if there was enough sex to call this a porn film. But there were a lot of fragments of sex acts between pimply, greasy, decidedly un-sexy actors in decidedly un-sexy surroundings.

There are some good, creepy moments here, but the English dialogue is so appalling bad that it's almost impossible to sit through the whole thing.  And why did the producers insist on Miike shooting this in English?  Any viewer of this series will know Miike, and would accept him shooting in his native language.

The whole point of Blu-ray is increased picture and sound quality, isn't it (the ""increased durability"" claim means nothing to those of use who put their discs back in the cases when we're done with them)?  The really frustrating thing about this disc is that some scenes--especially those involving a lot of color--practically jump off the screen.  But often the picture becomes horribly grainy, which probably looks bad on ANY t.v., but looks absolutely atrocious on my 52"" HDTV.Even the extras are lacking.  All you get is a commentary track, theatrical trailer, and a vintage featurette.  With the available space on a Blu-ray disc, plus the fact that there are additional materials on the film out there (as seen in the laserdisc release), the whole package seems nothing more that a rehash of the previous DVD release.For the unintiated, the film itself is a minor classic, although certain aspects haven't aged well.  Feminists will run screaming at the blantant sexism (a feature common in the supposedly-enlightened future of the original Star Trek as well), and the bright pastel costumes might elicit a few chuckles today.  But the story remains strong, the effects are very well-done, and the film does succeed in creating a believable otherworld of the future.  And for those of us who came of age in the late 70's, there is a nostalgic charm (not to mention a briefly-nude Jenny Agutter) to keep things interesting.

87833,0790728354,A2C27IQUH9N1Z,10,14,2003-08-08,Yikes!  Ouch!,"What a mess!  Tolkien wrote 4 books -- The Hobbit and its sequel, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, made up of The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King -- which together tell the story of the resurfacing and the destruction of the One Ring of Power wielded by Middle Earth's evil nemesis, Sauron.  The animated trilogy consists of The Hobbit and two films that should divide the trilogy in half, Lord of the Rings and The Return of the King, though so much material and so many characters are written out that they bear scant resemblance to the source material.  To further complicate matters, The Hobbit and The Return of the King are produced and directed by Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass, the team that brought to television almost every holiday classic that concerns Santa Claus, Frosty, Rudolph or the Easter Bunny, while the second film, The Lord of the Rings, was directed by Raph Bakshi.  Confused yet?  It's important to remember these facts because, other than catering to your need to be comprehensive, you will most likely enjoy Bakshi's effort but should run from the other two as if hellhounds were on your tail.There is so much missing here (including dropping major characters that were in the second instament!) that you will never comprehend the story as written by Tolkien, and even more importantly, the ubiquitous songs are SO plentiful, SO saccharin and SO dated that you may damage your fingers trying to fast forward through them all. DVD extras are slim -- textual screens about Tolkien, Middle Earth and the cast &amp; crew that were on the previous disks.Voice talent is good:  John Huston narrates and plays Gandalf, Orson Bean repeats as Bilbo and Frodo, and Roddy McDowall comes on board as Sam.  Also, the animation of scenery and sets is very good, though weaker with the characters.  Great liberties are taken with Tolkien's material.  Great honking abysmal liberties.The word 'travesty' may be a bit strong, but not by much.  I am generally a forgiving Tolkien fan, and indeed I enjoyed the animated Lord of the Rings directed by Bakshi just fine, but this is drek by a team that treated Tolkien as if he were just Jack Frost with hobbits.  For example, when he runs to Gandalf to let him know that Denethor is attempting suicide, Pippin yells, &quot;He's gone loony I tell ya!&quot;  I don't think you have to be a Tolkien geek to think that's just wrongThis film may appeal to the very young or the very deaf, but for anyone who has read the books, do yourself a favor and steer clear of this song-filled pillage of the 20th century's greatest work of literature.",2.0,0.7142857142857143,2,2,0.0,neutral,0.9927,very positive,2003,8,8

703160,B000067J13,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,1,3,2005-10-11,A Big Waste of Time,"""Happy Campers"" is a useful movie only because it prompts basic questions about its writer/director Daniel Waters and his breakout film ""Heathers"" (which he wrote but did not direct). Did he use up all his good stuff writing the Heathers screenplay and have nothing left for ""Happy Campers? Did he lose most of his active brain cells shortly after making Heathers (an event that would account for both the 'Hudson Hawk""and the ""Happy Campers"" screenplays)? Was Heathers just a happy accident? Or is Heathers so open-ended that critics and viewers attributed significance to a very ordinary movie. All these explanations are possible either jointly or collectively.For ""Happy Campers"" Waters tries to weave ""Breakfast Club"" themes into a ""Meatballs"" story. So you get tedious voice-over suggestions about how the artificial bounds of the high school hierarchy can sometimes be bridged by spending a couple months together as summer camp counselors. Like each detention server in ""The Breakfast Club"", each counselor is an easily identified stereotype. And over the course of camp each is supposed to go through changes, at least that appears to be the premise.Unfortunately the script has difficulty communicating this process despite an unprecedented amount of voice-over narration. All seven of the main characters get some voice-over time, a device that is very confusing and pretty much destroys any possibility of the movie having any unified theme.Dominique Swain has the biggest part as Wendy, the terminally peppy cheerleader type (appropriately pictured in a cheerleader outfit on the DVD). Swain is the only good thing about the movie, it is an over-the-top caricature that plays to her acting strengths. This is the type of role Swain should be playing, one that requires self-parody rather than subtlety. She also benefits by relative comparison to James (Jaime) King-whose acting skills are in the Kathy Ireland mold, as well as from being paired with the physically miscast Brad Renfro-who manages to drain all energy from each scene in which he appears. The other four counselors have a fair about of screen time and some lame misadventures but nothing particularly memorable.Some effort is made to introduce the actual summer campers to the story but none of it even remotely works. ""Meatballs"" was able to get away with shallow character development because it was basically just a Bill Murray vehicle. Although Swain might have been able to carry the whole thing like Murray the script does not allow this and things never really get going in ""Happy Campers"".Waters apparently believed that audiences would react positively to a movie where 90% of the comedy involved sexual references that most preteens would consider moronic. Hey Daniel, did you pay someone to write that Heathers"" screenplay for you.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",2.0,0.3333333333333333,2,1,-0.4215,negative,0.9953,very positive,2005,10,11

When ALADDIN was released to home video, pressure  groups insisted some lyrics of the opening song be changed from the  theatrical release (of course they weren't changed on the soundtrack CD  which came with the &quot;special edition&quot; video release).  When  MELODY TIME was first released to home video in 1998, the cigarette  dangling from the mouth of the character Pecos Bill was edited out  (evidently Disney villains can smoke, but not the hero).  When THE LITTLE  MERMAID was re-released to home video in 1998, the advertising said Fully  Restored - but the closing credits were pushed to one side to make room for  a &quot;music video&quot; and the song was not even the original song  accompanying those end credits - this is restored?And now we have MAKE  MINE MUSIC - the last of the animated Disney features to be released on  home video (some had previously been released on laser disc but not video).

910271,B0009PLLN6,A1IBSQQHGCDUAN,2,5,2005-08-04,"Wanted to like it, but...","While I'm not joining the ranks of those who are jumping on Oliver Stone's ass as a has-been, ""Alexander"" is not a very good argument to the contrary.  The last really good movie I saw from Stone was probably ""U-Turn"", a great little sleeper if there ever was one.  ""Any Given Sunday"" had it's moments but tried way too hard to live up to the lifestyle insanity perpetrated by lesser gridiron flicks like ""The Program"" and ""Varsity Blues"".  ""Alexander"" is as tragically flawed as it's title character, a horrendous series of missteps that overlap so often that, for reviewing purposes, it's difficult to keep track of them all.I hate to be a Colin-basher, but like many I also didn't feel Farrell was convincing as the greatest conqueror the world had ever seen.  Sure, he pulled off impetuous, daring, and (dare I say it?) even gay with aplomb, but I believe the problem lies in the script.  Even Anthony Hopkins came off as a little hokey, but given the dialogue what can you expect?  Perhaps the worst was Angelina Jolie, a vaguely incestuous background presence for Alexander throughout the movie.  I really can't emphasize how badly the dialogue helped to tank the movie.  It veers wildly from hackneyed ""Ye gods why hast thou forsaken me?"" platitudes to sheerly incomprehensible wannabe Homeric/Shakespearean ranting.  You can certainly tell what it is that they're trying to get across but you can't make yourself believe that even a people in a completely different world than ours would talk to each other in this manner.  However, the dialogue is only part of the problem, and I think if we compare ""Alexander"" to Stone's other historical dramas we can get a little closer to the root of the problem.Regardless of the amount of conjecture involved in bringing the stories of both JFK and Richard Nixon to the screen, both of those movies worked for a reason:  an unflagging attention to detail.  The reason most Hollywood biopics feel formulaic (even the beloved ""Ray"" is largely guilty of this) is because the life of a man is complex and not always rational; some of the more jagged edges are often sanded down to make it less confusing for the average viewer.  However, in doing so you run the risk of making your movie seem less like watching someone's life play out on the screen and more like a typical Hollywood melodrama.  If ""JFK"" and ""Nixon"" are guilty of all manner of sins under the sun they are certainly not guilty of being ""Hollywood"".  These films worked because Oliver Stone took his time to really get inside the heads of these men and tell their tales, regardless of how many scenes or how much screen time it took to do so.But there's one big difference between those films and ""Alexander"": budget.  Yet the reason such an extravagant budget is required for this film but not the others is that neither JFK nor Nixon required huge action set pieces to tell their story.  For Alexander there is no other way.  From the age when most of us are having our first (legal) beer, Al was on the battlefield, carving his empire into the history books.  We also have another problem here:  the passage of time.  JFK and Nixon were both products of the 60s, and there is a wealth of detailed writing available on the intimacies of their psyches.  With Alexander we still have a great deal of chronicling of his exploits, but what we have mostly pertains to his military and political exploits, which leaves the mind of the man open to interpretation (ie. we know that up until the time of Philip's death Alexander was tutored by Aristotle - as famed a philosopher as ever Alexander would be a conqueror - but as to the substance of those teachings history is at a complete loss).  So it's just possible that Oliver Stone's strengths lay in other areas than psychoanalysis.  You can certainly tell a story without having any real insight into the human mind - pick up any mass market paperback for proof of that - and you can also film a pretty spiffy movie without being able to tell a story.  My guess is we're finding out that Stone's strengths reside somewhere between those two extremes, and if so, it's the choice of subject matter, scripts, etc. which will make or break his movies.  In the meantime let's not be too quick to make or break his legacy based on one or two misfires.",2.0,0.4,1,3,0.3612,positive,-0.9519,very negative,2005,8,4

1099151,B000V6LSOA,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,2,6,2008-04-20,Just. Die. Already.,"I was looking forward to this film when first announcements were made. An all-star cast, a screenplay adapted by Michael Cunningham, whose work on The Hours I admire. (I admit I am unfamiliar with the work of Susan Minot, who wrote the book.) So what happens when you put all these sure-fire ingredients in a pot and set to boil?Sadly, not much.Evening is the flattest two hours I've been through in a while. We spend our time with a rather boring woman who chews her pillowcase while dying and takes forever to shuffle off.  (I had this image of her two daughters downstairs mixing cyanide into her medicine to speed things along.) While she's dying she flashes back to one weekend in her life, a weekend that, all in all, is pretty ordinary. If this is what she flashes back to as her greatest moments on earth, she must have had a dull life. Did she ever do anything *really* exciting, like order pizza?Evening is supposed to be tinged with regret and sadness and all that weepy stuff. Fair enough, but we never really understand why all the regret, why Harris (Patrick Wilson) was her only love, or why that one weekend in her life stayed with her forever. Sure, they're telling us she made the wrong choice, but we don't really see why he was the right choice.  Of course, late in the film we get the almost obligatory scene where they meet up years later, each has settled down to apparently tepid marriages, and they still harbor desire for each other. (""I still remember which stars are ours! And hey, I just named Sputnik after you, too!"") To add corn to the cob, he mentions that his new son is named--got your kleenex ready?--Buddy!  Claire Danes can play these kinds of scenes so well there ought to be a special Academy Award just for her. But despite her Herculean efforts, and the fine acting by her costar and Gap khaki conspirator Patrick Wilson, the moment is so clich&eacute;d it nearly degenerates into self-parody.The film is much too checkerboarded. There are too many pointless flashbacks and flash-forwards. You should not go back and forth unless you have a reason to interrupt the story flow, but time after time when we change times, nothing new has happened since the last time we left. Particularly with the Redgrave scenes, she just lies on the bed, mutters something linking to the past, and we flash back there. So why did we bother to come back to the present in the first place?The interwoven story of the contemporary daughters, played by Toni Collette and Miranda Richardson, is heavy-handed. Oh yes, restless Collette is urged by mommy not to repeat her mistakes and to ""try to be happy!"" Boo-hoo. The other daughter...well, what the heck *does* the other daughter do? Nothing, really. She doesn't even talk to her dying mother much.And then there's Hugh Dancy, as Buddy, who was only a minor character in the book but who is made a major player in the screenplay. Despite having his part lengthened, the writers didn't give him much depth. He comes on as the classic slacker, and it's quickly established that his best friend is Jack Daniels. He spends most of his time on screen getting drunk, and the filmmakers telegraph his eventual fate with semaphores. He too has the hots for Ann. (All the guys in this movie have the hots for Ann; all the chicks have the hots for Harris, except that Buddy also seems to have the hots for Harris. It plays like an episode of ""Soap."") Yet we really don't get why. Ann is very sweet and kind to him early on, seemingly wanting to rekindle something old. Yet when he finally reveals his feelings for her, she explodes at him and tells him to get a life. It's one of those Dramatic Moments that's completely unearned; it seems to come from nowhere, and instead of being emotionally-moved we are just left puzzled. (The other male lead is equally shallow: what is so special about Harris? As played by Patrick Wilson, he's stiff and charmless and not even especially handsome, yet we're supposed to see him as a chick magnet. The story never bothers to show why. Explaining the motivation of any of these characters seems beneath it.  They want our tears without earning them.)Also puzzling to me is the scene where Ann sings after the wedding. In the middle, uninvited and unasked, Harris gets up, climbs onstage and joins her, turning her solo that she's been rehearsing all week into a duet. Maybe the filmmakers thought this was somehow tender or an indication of how they belonged together; me, I thought it was obnoxious. This wasn't open mike night, and nobody asked him to sing. Maybe if afterwards he'd told her how wonderful she'd been, if he seemed to appreciate her in ways the others hadn't, it would have played better.Evening smacks of trying to be about more than it was. It has this feeling of a deep and profound secret, but it never comes. We keep waiting for the magic moment to tie it all together, but we never get one.The best thing about the movie is Danes. I type that so often in movies she is in that I ought to install a macro on my computer. Claire Danes can make my eyes tear...just by being Claire Danes. I don't know how she does it, but for just one example, there's a scene near the end of her cooking and trying to be a 50's domestic housewife that, for some reason I can't explain, really got to me. If some other actress played the part, it wouldn't have worked. Why, I don't know, except to say there's something very pure and very real that she manages to telegraph. The producers say she was the first person they thought of when they set about casting. They were smart to do so.The rest of the cast does well, too, but they can't hide the fact that Evening--the film at least; can't comment on the novel--really isn't about much.  But it thinks it's about a lot. And it takes its sweet time telling it.The DVD transfer looks beautiful. The location for this movie is breathtaking, and filmmakers milk it for all its worth, with no shortage of vivid colors and pastel sunsets. The two bonus featurettes are of the kissy-kissy ""I'm-working-with-the-most-talented-people-in-the-world"" variety.",2.0,0.3333333333333333,2,1,-0.5994,negative,0.9982,very positive,2008,4,20

I think.  The details got lost in all of the fog being blown around for the last hour and a half.To be fair, the movie actually started off fairly well.  If you're an Evil Dead fan, you'll recognize immediately a similar film style utilized here, but only at an environmental angle.  The moving ground shots through hazy nighttime forest, etc.  It's a nod in the right direction, so I feel I owe Anstey some recognition for that.  He also did a decent job of spooking me.  Every so often a form will move silently through the background and it's startling.  Well, the first ten times it was, I should say.  He must have known it was working because he kept doing it and doing it and doing it, and......THIS is where I start stomping on his effort.The film went nowhere.  It gained a little momentum in the beginning, but quickly began bleating one note and stayed that way through its entirety.  Keeping my hand away from the fast-forward button on my remote because I promised myself I'd not review the movie unless I'd seen the whole thing was exhausting.The banshee got on my nerves right away.  The screaming was obnoxious.  I know that's what banshees DO, but it drove me nuts.The main actress wasn't very good.  At all.  She basically spends the whole movie going from panicky to wide-eyed and back to panicky, rinse and repeat.  At one point in the movie, she's on a balcony looking down and her eyes are huge.  Cut to a different scene, then back to the balcony and she's looking down again with an almost identical face.  She just kept doing that.Weakest zombies ever.  One undead guy walks into the house, gets their attention, dumps his guts on the floor, then starts flaccidly punching at them.  When he connects, they act as if they've been hit by a Thor's hammer, but there's no way.  NO way.  If anything, this movie gave me hope that when zombies finally do start perusing my populace, they'll be walking daffodils like the creatures in this little ditty.The music was sporadic and poorly placed.  Multiple genres fluttered around carelessly until the end scene when one of the worst songs I've heard brings the whole house crashing down around me.I don't know what else to say.

It stayed that way until one day (long into the series) the public learned that each and every episode was personally approved by the Director of the FBI --- the man himself --- J. Edgar Hoover.

The most beloved character, Jack Sparrow did not show up until the end of the first hour into the movie, and the scene of his first appearance was the best, the funniest, and sadly, the only scene in the movie that I liked. It showed Jack Sparrow trapped on the sea of sand in Davy Jones' Locker as the captain and the multiple members of the crew. The scene brought to memory the famous sequence from Being John Malcovich and it was the highest point of the movie. After that, Jack was moved to the periphery of the plot which was so incoherent that the film creators actually came up with the list of FAQ that baffled moviegoers had about the total mess of the final installment in the pirate trilogy. The list was included with the DVD. The original idea to make a movie based on the popular Walt Disney theme park ride proved to be great for two first movies that are funny and entertaining. The idea to create a philosophical-metaphysical-mythological epilogue to the series in the traditions of Lord of the Rings turned to be disastrous. The movie failed flat in all directions. I was either bored or laughed at the scenes that were not meant to be unintentionally funny. Even appearance of Keith Richards, Johnny Depp's inspiration for the role of Jack Sparrow, as Jack's father did not help much.

1126899,B0010X73ZG,A2NSEHGMUSE2U2,13,18,2007-11-25,Why Re-write The Classic,"Stephen King's The Mist was probably the most requested story-to-film project of all of King's books and stories, so says his publicist.  No one could've been more excited about this picture finally being made than I, an avid fan of King's novels and short stories since his beginning.  I believe that a lot of fans breathed a sigh of ""finally"" when they heard the project was under way.  And Frank Darabont has had a decent track record with King movies, if a short track for sure.  Still, they had a great ensemble cast, lead by Thomas Jane, and with cgi in full swing these days, this film had the potential of becoming a modern day science-fiction classic, in the same way that B-films like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", and ""The Quatermass X-periment"" have become undeniable classics over the years.I asked my teenage daughter to go with me, for she too is a Stephen King fan, and I knew we were going to see something special.  About halfway through the film, I was marveling at how Darabont had gotten it down right, how good it felt, dark and frightening, otherwordly and atmospheric.  I knew the story, I'd read it so many times, because I frankly love this sci-fi/horror adventure, like I love Bradbury's Fahrenheit-451, or John Cambell's ""Who Goes There"", so I knew there were no surprises that a fifteen year old shouldn't see.  I was enjoying myself so much, that I was already planning to ask other people to go to it, just so I had an excuse to see it again.  And even acknowledged that I'd be buying this movie on DVD as soon as it was available.And then when it happened in the last seven minutes of the film, when all the preceding story was mocked and destroyed in a kind of low-blow, cosmic joke, in which the main characters all decided to act against character, to step out of the classic story arc, and destroy a wonderfully paced film by turning it into a cynical existencial joke on mankind, I kept thinking, 'No way, they are not going to do this.  They can't.' But they did, and I sat there stunned, muttering, ""I can't believe they did this.  They've ruined it.""  I'd waited all these years, since I first read the novella in 1983, for this film, and they ruined it. My daughter looked at me and said exactly what I was thinking, ""I thought he would wake up and it would be a nightmare, but he didn't"".I won't spoil the ending for you, because it can't be spoiled any more so than watching does on its own.  If you want to know before you go to see the film, it's all over the place now, written in movie reviews and on blogs.I've read many comments from film goers that liked or 'loved' the new twist ending, but my feeling is they never read or appriciated the original story.  There are just as many, and maybe a little bit more, of us who absolutely hated the ending.  And we know it's because that's not how it ended in the novella.  We know that David Drayton's character would not have ended the story that way.  There just is absolutely no indication that he had that character attribute at any time in the preceding story.  Not one hint.  You just don't do that in good story-telling.I read somewhere that Darabont sent that change in the script to Stephen King and he said something like, ""I wish I'd thought of that ending"".  I can tell you that it is my experience that fiction editors do not like dark, cynical endings unless they are hinted at in the preceding story, and if King had written The Mist with the ending that is now in the film version forever, The Mist in novella form would most likely never have seen print.  I kind of wish it hadn't now, then I wouldn't have wanted a film version so badly.

1154887,B0016Q2D5M,A1GB0HW46Y2EB,1,2,2012-02-22,Two Dimensions of This are Enough,"Actually, I didn't watch this masterpiece in 3D.  Two dimensions of it were sufficient for me and I'm giving it one star for each dimension.  We have a story in which Brendan Fraser's scientist brother Max has disappeared and Trevor (Brendan Fraser)  is setting out to search for him.  But he gets saddled with having to care for Sean, Max's son played by Josh Hutcherson, who starts out as a bratty teenager and, of course, is initially p......d-off at the world.  (Actually, I was suspicious that Max simply couldn't stand Sean any longer and just took off).But, no. They follow Max's trail, aided by pretty guide, Hannah (Anita Briem) who causes Sean to drool a little, to the mouth of a volcano. They all begin to fall down a rabbit hole and finally land on a heap of sticks  and dry leaves -- no, I'm sorry, that's in Alice in Wonderland.  The volcano's hole turns into a water slide and they enter into a world that resembles a defective ride in a theme park.  They discover that Max had died there, of boredom no doubt, and encounter gigantic Venus flytraps (I  never saw any gigantic flies, though), dinosaurs stomping around and birds that glow in the dark.  They also get to ride in a mining car which turns into a roller-coaster that manages to jump across a ten foot gap and land on the tracks on the other side, the chances against that happening being about 30 billion to one.  At another point on their raft, a sharp-toothed fish is getting closer and closer to taking a bite out of Hannah's rump as Sean is watching and his lips seem to be saying ""Go for it, go for it!""Even though I was watching this movie in 2D, it was obvious that it was shot in 3D because actors are seen pointing out at the camera or shooting a yo-yo out of the frame at you or some other shenanigans, which simply stalls any continuity this film might have had.  By the time it's over Sean has transformed into a smiling puppy, licking his uncle's hand or whatever.The 1959 version of this story is a much superior film, having actors such as James Mason, Arlene Dahl and Pat Boone (Pat Boone??  Yes, it is Pat Boone), it's rather antique special effects notwithstanding.  Some shots were actually made in Carlsbad Caverns, I believe.  Now, you can't get more realistic than that.  The backgrounds in this new film look very much like painted scenery flats and the dinosaur chase scene with the characters running in the foreground on a treadmill is clearly a green screen process not particularly well executed.I had completely forgotten that Brendan Fraser had done a really nice acting job in the fine film ""Gods and Monsters.""

Because of one silly (but not implausible) mistake, they cannot get on board again. And no one (except a little baby) remains on board to help them out.Some viewers would think the premise is impossible, but German director Hans Horn insists this film is inspired by what really happened. I don't know, but if so, the film must be based on the real events very loosely. Tagline of ""Open Water 2: Adrift"" reads ""Fatigue. Hypothermia. Death,"" and probably the death would be a very slow one in reality. However, the film's muddled script quickens it in sometimes most incredible ways.I cannot write about how incredible it could be because to explain means to reveal some of the crucial parts of the story. But I can say that these people are not without some tools when they dropped into the water. While looking at the characters floating and struggling in the water, most of us would say to ourselves, ""Why don't they...?""Of course people in a panic and fear do ridiculous mistakes. But when they continue to mistake in this way, audiences just begin to care less and less about the characters -- and most of them are not exactly likable persons when they first showed up (how many of us would throw your wife overboard who is clearly terrified?).

Paul Dini and Co. put together a terrific show that featured a great cast, fantastic stories with both familiar and new villians, and gave us a series that immediately took a special place in our hearts.  Tim Daily voiced Superman, while known actor Clancy Brown gave us an incredible aristocratic sinister Lex Luthor.  Then, in 1998, Superman TAS came to an end with the epic series finale, ""Legacy.""  Superman would then appear in the Batman Beyond episode, ""The Call,"" which featured a futuristic version of the Justice League, which then lead into Justice League and Justice League Unlimited, which just finished up.  A few months ago, in getting ready for Superman Returns, WB announced they were bringing our animated boy scout back with his first animated direct to video feature.  It was an exciting announcement to hear, but now, after seeing the movie, WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY DOING??!!The plot was terrible, if that is what you could call it.  The music was average, the dialog was attrocious, and my god, the voice acting felt like it came from some 80s anime dub. First off, Luthor is voiced by Powers Boothe instead of Clancy Brown, and boy, how terrible he was. Powers played Gorilla Grodd in Justice League, but for some reason, he sounds more like some low rank amateur in the voice acting department here.  Luthor was already out of character the moment the movie started, but this guy made Luthor sound more like a fool than a villian.  Next up is Brainiac, who also had a new voice actor (Bishop from Aliens), and Lance seemed like he was trying to sound like the Manhunters from JL rather Brainiac, and he was even worse than Luthor in the acting department. In fact, the only characters that didn't seem to have new voices were Superman (Tim Daily is back, but he must have left his skills with Legacy), Lois, Perry, and the Kents. Jimmy sounds similar, but Mercy sounds like some dumb blonde out of California.The movie did have its good points, like the scenes that did not have Luthor or Brainiac in it, of course, that was probably maybe a good 15-20 minutes total, if that.Overall, this movie is just plain out bad. Were they even trying to put a story together, or did WB just want some junk put out in time for Returns? I don't know. If this is where the DC universe is headed now that JLU is over, then I am quite pleased it is done.  I cannot give this movie anything more than a 2/5 stars, and that is being kind to it.Oh, and the special features are just a bunch of trailers.",2.0,0.8571428571428571,1,3,0.0,neutral,0.9853,very positive,2006,6,16
235053,6300269590,APP5MBH2BSX6I,6,11,2004-08-31,How to ruin a good premise,"Of all the popular authors of recent years, Michael Crichton has to be the one with the most uneven track record of film adaptation.  Success with material like ""The Andromeda Strain"" and ""Jurassic Park,"" and even TV's ""ER,"" is tempered by sludge like ""Congo"" and this near disaster.  Should only be viewed by film students who want to learn how NOT to make a film.The premise is that a man named Harry Benson (George Segal) has suffered a brain injury that causes seizures resulting in uncontrollable violent behavior.  He volunteers to undergo implantation of a ""limbic pacer,"" which is kind of like a pacemaker but it's in the brain, controlling the seizures.  Naturally the procedure (first ever in a human) doesn't work, and we see the disastrous results of said failure.Yes, the entire plot is really as simple as that.  It is a situation fraught with opportunity for psychological drama that would draw us in, involving the subject's mental anguish on a personal and interpersonal level.  Instead Segal practically sleep-walks through the whole thing, apparently bored to death with his psychotic life.Adding to the boredom is the bizarre directorial decision to use practically no musical soundtrack.  Perhaps the belief was that it would heighten the otherworldliness and detachment of the characters from their situation, as much of the other direction goes to great lengths to dehumanize almost everyone in this film, taking its cue from Benson's belief that the computers of his day (1974) were competing with humans and would eventually take over the world.  Any resemblance to ""The Matrix"" abruptly ends there, as the director chooses to use that belief as a backdrop that only makes the film dull to the point of somnolence.I could nitpick about the technical errors regarding the OR, such as (1) having virtually no conversation among OR personnel, (2) horrendous sound editing, and (3) postoperative dictation in which the surgeon feels he has to carefully spell the inanely common term ""limbic.""  There are even two embarrassing moments early in the film when two different characters voice their opposition to the surgery, one who states ""I'm against it"" at a moment when a more thorough explanation would be appropriate, and another who inappropriately rambles on and on with a veritable sermon on hell fire and brimstone.  Laughably bad.The story is interesting enough and most of the supporting actors are credible, but overall this turkey should be left as a monument to bad ideas in filmmaking of the early 1970s.

Me, too, but here we only see her back-up boys.","Sade is a true cultural jewel, her music, her dance, her regal presence, her walk. Sade is a joy and a strength to watch, to watch closely, carefully, and long, her subtlety of expression slowly unfolding, slowly self-revealing, like a flower, her voice mostly long and slow, her eyes slowly opening, turning, her expression ever subtle, her fluid, queenly walk.Sade is earth mother queen, strong, suffering, oppressed, impoverished, real.I love to watch her, the soft, hard, sad, joyful expression of her face, the subtle changes her face drifts through, the way she walks about the stage barefoot, so gently, yet strong, a joy and a wonder to behold, just beautiful, really strong, and proud under all the centuries of oppression, regal, a healing power to observe.I eagerly purchased this DVD therefore, knowing I may sit back and watch Sade, to be healed at last from all of my own pain and blues and oppression, and come to wellness through watching one sideways glance of Sade.Not hereSade sings long and low, and moves slowly, subtly, walking, and dancing, and moving elegantly as she dresses, sensual as a cat, beautiful as a queen.We cannot watch her here, slowly, as we need, watching her expression unfold within its own time, as a beautiful flower unfurls, slowly.See that Sade Walking section of the extra material. Some barker named Craig rushes her as she prepares herself physically, mentally and spiritually for what was to come, in peace and composure, the secret of Sade, her composure, yet Craig yaps loudly at my queen of earth: Can we get there in under one minute? rushing our queen very disrespectfully to the stage; makes me mad.Once on the stage, in the main concert material section here, we never really see Sade except for quick glimpses from the far back of the stadium. All that we see is that one musician with a saxophone doing little that's new on the saxophone, hey, Kenny G., ok? we heard the record thanks, but the camera snap cutting to linger on him while he does, nothing interesting, visually, or really, musically. We want to see Sade, our queen, not another guy on sax.We got Sade standing nearby pouring out her heart and soul like thick sad honey, yet are forced to watch very closely this one guy on a horn, each time he moves and most often when he does not.Same with the back up keyboard guy, just standing over his keyboards, with glasses, nothing happening at all, same as it ever was, as Sade breathes long, unseen, nearby.Couple of male back up singers just standing there, doing nothing, while Sade walks like a royal feline across the stage, barefoot, unseen.Dudes, you the editing guy who had so much caffeinated canned drinks as to NOT LEAVE THE CAMERA ON ONE PLACE FOR MORE THAN THREE seconds, unless its on that SAX player, as soon as he starts and well after he's finished, or that guitar scratcher (often one and the same person), or on the KEYBOARDS(?!) (dude keyboards!? nothing happening there ok, not EVEN with your instant snaps edit to other things, like an angry wasp dashing around)then the crowd. We see more of the crowd than of Sade, the same few people, over and over, MORE THAN SADE!this is ill. I paid good money, why? to see some sax player blow his nose?NO! to see Sade. long and strong.To watch Sade do her thing, her queenly thing, her healing thing. Others might not understand.To find healing through Sade, her calmness under oppression, her composure, her joy. Her strength. Her subtlety.Not to watch some sax player, whose mom probably LOVES this dvd, but not me.I come to see Sade, and can find her nowhere, except in very tiny long shots during the most intimate moments of her songs, when we should be RIGHT UP IN HER FACE LOOKING, the camera runs to the back of the stadium, that darn it all constantly MOVING camera . . .Here was a great opportunity to really get a Sade concert, to see Sade, closely, and to watch her perform. Sade is a great cultural treasure which we must sip slowly, meditate even, but we cannot with this see her at all.At all.Instead we get seasick from the constantly moving camera and constant quick cuts. The camera operator should LOSE his license and the editor all his technology, and after this debacle, this destruction of Sade, they probably have. Who would hire them after this? Oh wait, this is Muller, Sade's favorite rock video director, the same one who did the other Sade live video?Once or twice, after the viewer has lost ALL hope of EVER actually, you know, kind of, like, watching Sade, the camera almost creeps up quietly, respectfully, for a close up, but as soon as it gets in range, and we can see our queen's thought, and BIG heart, like an angry fly the camera IMMEDIATELY flops on the sax player, again, and stays with him.The team here must REALLY hate Sade, can't stand the sight of her, fears any falling in love with her, as we are, we who buy this dvd praying we may see her in her fullness and beauty and grace.I mean, I really did NOT buy this dvd to watch that sax blower. I got it to see Sade, and I cannot find her here.The camera roams violently like a ravenously hungry lone wolf, like a panther prowling, like a great white shark, move or die, constantly swirling, and then quick cutting the band members (!!!) in a feeding frenzy orgy of band members, MUSICIANS just hanging out standing around right where and how they were the last time we saw them, never Sade seen, She who must be seen.That camera must remain seated and watching, quietly and patiently, like in a classical concert, watching and admiring, silently seated motionless, maturely.Instead what we get is as if Sade comes to your state fair and you go, like, wow, dudes, we could really get a RIGHTEOUS view of Sadey from the ROLLER COASTER!! and every now and again, as if by accident, when the roller coaster happens to be pointing towards the stage, there you might VERY QUICKLY see, a tiny speck which may really be Sade, far away, before you twist quickly on the rails, plunging to certain death . . .not recommended for anyone who knows and loves Sade.go listen instead toFeel No Painand toLong Hard RoadorPearlsor from her second albumPromiseJezebelorSoldier of LoveorThe Sweetest GiftorIt's Only Love That Gets You Throughor the restThey do do Jezebel here, and Pearls, but that camera remains so hyperkinetic AGAINST the music that the camera kills it, and even in these we see no Sade as we MUST, as we need, as we deserve to.But just busily flying around like a lost housefly banging aimlessly at a window.and we weep to watch her, still, left in peace, to watch her alone, as her voice brings peace and compassion and relief and mercy and hope and strength where there is not now hope, nor strength, and no love.I just really want to watch herThe greatest face in modern music, sinceLady Day: The Many Faces Of Billie Holiday, the greatest voice sinceStrange Fruit, the most musical moves in modern music, the most regal presence and loving prescience under absolute destitute oppression, hope in our poverty, peace in our warrior times, yet here we cannot find her, in this dvd we cannot see her, because the editor and camera operator finds only the back up boys interesting.this is not fair. this is a crime, against humanity.this is not to see Sade where she is most meant to be.That glance, across the side of those beautiful eyes, tells all, but we cannot see it here upon this travesty of what was to be.I can only turn sadly away into sorrow now, alone, more alone now forever, without this great and beautiful and knowing friend who is Sade.I mean, please please please, at least during Jezebel, so personal, so intimate, so thoughtful, the secret of this life, so individual, couldn't then at least this hyper-kinetic camera STOP and WATCH this wonder who is Sade, tear her heart out and ours, and come up with strength to go, along this long hard road, feeling no pain, PLEASE. Shout Alleluia and shout it again; this we do not see, but in passing, by accident, as if filmed from the cap of a guy who left his seat to go get candy during the quiet part.NO, the motion goes on. It's like going to a real personal Sade concert with a kid on too much candy, moving, moving, moving, all of the time, and never SEEING; this is like going to high Mass at a cathedral with Pee Wee Herman on sugar by our side, when I came only to see Sade.Yes.

Tolkien wrote 4 books -- The Hobbit and its sequel, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, made up of The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King -- which together tell the story of the resurfacing and the destruction of the One Ring of Power wielded by Middle Earth's evil nemesis, Sauron.  The animated trilogy consists of The Hobbit and two films that should divide the trilogy in half, Lord of the Rings and The Return of the King, though so much material and so many characters are written out that they bear scant resemblance to the source material.  To further complicate matters, The Hobbit and The Return of the King are produced and directed by Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass, the team that brought to television almost every holiday classic that concerns Santa Claus, Frosty, Rudolph or the Easter Bunny, while the second film, The Lord of the Rings, was directed by Raph Bakshi.  Confused yet?  It's important to remember these facts because, other than catering to your need to be comprehensive, you will most likely enjoy Bakshi's effort but should run from the other two as if hellhounds were on your tail.There is so much missing here (including dropping major characters that were in the second instament!) that you will never comprehend the story as written by Tolkien, and even more importantly, the ubiquitous songs are SO plentiful, SO saccharin and SO dated that you may damage your fingers trying to fast forward through them all. DVD extras are slim -- textual screens about Tolkien, Middle Earth and the cast &amp; crew that were on the previous disks.Voice talent is good:  John Huston narrates and plays Gandalf, Orson Bean repeats as Bilbo and Frodo, and Roddy McDowall comes on board as Sam.  Also, the animation of scenery and sets is very good, though weaker with the characters.  Great liberties are taken with Tolkien's material.  Great honking abysmal liberties.The word 'travesty' may be a bit strong, but not by much.  I am generally a forgiving Tolkien fan, and indeed I enjoyed the animated Lord of the Rings directed by Bakshi just fine, but this is drek by a team that treated Tolkien as if he were just Jack Frost with hobbits.  For example, when he runs to Gandalf to let him know that Denethor is attempting suicide, Pippin yells, &quot;He's gone loony I tell ya!&quot;  I don't think you have to be a Tolkien geek to think that's just wrongThis film may appeal to the very young or the very deaf, but for anyone who has read the books, do yourself a favor and steer clear of this song-filled pillage of the 20th century's greatest work of literature.",2.0,0.7142857142857143,2,2,0.0,neutral,0.9927,very positive,2003,8,8

1473043,B005LAIHR2,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,0,2,2013-01-15,Fails to be the tribute it aims to be,"This review is coming from a 21 year old who is huge fan of 80's music, fashion and culture that borders on the obsession. After hearing about the Rock of Ages film project I feared it would be a big Hollywood production that would end up as a B film as best and wouldn't pay proper tribute to the 1980's, the music and the scene it attempts to tribute. This is more of less exactly what happened. There are some nice moments and entertaining parts, and some versions of the songs are actually decent but it fails to be a modern day Grease or whatever it was that they attempted it to be. It's as if they didn't know what they wanted to do with this except have some popular 80's tune, a bit of a throwback to the fashion of the era and try to hold it together with songs, Grease and some of the other musicals I've seen had heart.Rock of Ages is set in L.A. on the Sunset Strip in 1987, to start it has the time and setting properly set. The look and atmosphere is just about right which are sure to bring back memories. The song selection is for the most part very good and much of what you would expect musically wise: ""Don't Stop Believin'"" (Journey) ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" (Bon Jovi), ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"" (Def Leppard), 'Hit Me With Your Best Shot' (Pat Benatar), ""I Wanna Rock"" (Twisted Sister), ""Sister Christian"" (Night Ranger) and many others.Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx is one of the few actual things that does work for Rock of Ages. His performances and duets were the more enjoyable ones due to his given Rockstar character and his portrayal of Stacee. Cruise's character comes off as a true rockstar of the 80's and it looks like he based his performance on the rockers of the era (Axl Rose mostly in terms of style and fashion).  It's not amazing acting but he is likeable as the sleazy rockstar. I like Russel Brand usually but even if he almost always looks like and carries a rockstar vibe was lame in this film. His character's interactions with his bar owner friend are homoerotic and almost uncomfortable to watch. Julianne Hall and Diego Boneta as and Sherrie and Drew the two stars are likeable and well cast and Rock of Ages really revolves around their story.I started watching Rock of Ages with little hope of it actually good, but with an open mind and expecting at least to be entertained. It more or less succeed at being a 'good' film in my opinion and misses in some areas I thought. To me the big problem with Rock of Ages is that it doesn't tell a story to which you can relate or get into land as a musical, that's not good. I love the 80's but my friends who saw this couldn't get why or what I like about the decade and it does't make it look cool and I don't think it would make any audience want to live them just for one day. It somehow misses and doesn't connect with it's audience because it's too self-obsessed with almost being a parody to create genuine feelings that can be related to, it just doesn't work all that well. It is fun and some of it is entertaining but it doesn't come off anywhere near great.Overall, it comes off as karaoke with some interesting versions and some rather poor ones and what seemed like a potentially good story was thrown away. It's a big production with big names to appeal to the general public but it fails to pay proper tribute to the 1980's which was the main goal unfortunately. I'm sure there was a market for this film just as I'm sure there are quite a few 80's enthusiast and nostalgics who are downright embarrassed by Rock of Ages. It lacks heart an substance and was very Glee-like. Towards the end it was getting a little to painful to watch for this viewer as it was getting long. I like that they wanted to pay homage to the 80's and the music but the story wasn't anywhere near captivating and although some of the musical numbers are fun and entertaining, Rock of Ages falls short of what it hopes to be. It doesn't translate to film so well. 2.5 out of 5.P.S. there's a great bonus feature 'Legends of the Strip' mini documentary of the era with major rock artists that lived the 80's and tell tales and stories about the Sunset Strip, the music and the fashion. that's worth watching",2.0,0.0,1,4,-0.4215,negative,0.9989,very positive,2013,1,15

87833,0790728354,A2C27IQUH9N1Z,10,14,2003-08-08,Yikes!  Ouch!,"What a mess!  Tolkien wrote 4 books -- The Hobbit and its sequel, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, made up of The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King -- which together tell the story of the resurfacing and the destruction of the One Ring of Power wielded by Middle Earth's evil nemesis, Sauron.  The animated trilogy consists of The Hobbit and two films that should divide the trilogy in half, Lord of the Rings and The Return of the King, though so much material and so many characters are written out that they bear scant resemblance to the source material.  To further complicate matters, The Hobbit and The Return of the King are produced and directed by Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass, the team that brought to television almost every holiday classic that concerns Santa Claus, Frosty, Rudolph or the Easter Bunny, while the second film, The Lord of the Rings, was directed by Raph Bakshi.  Confused yet?  It's important to remember these facts because, other than catering to your need to be comprehensive, you will most likely enjoy Bakshi's effort but should run from the other two as if hellhounds were on your tail.There is so much missing here (including dropping major characters that were in the second instament!) that you will never comprehend the story as written by Tolkien, and even more importantly, the ubiquitous songs are SO plentiful, SO saccharin and SO dated that you may damage your fingers trying to fast forward through them all. DVD extras are slim -- textual screens about Tolkien, Middle Earth and the cast &amp; crew that were on the previous disks.Voice talent is good:  John Huston narrates and plays Gandalf, Orson Bean repeats as Bilbo and Frodo, and Roddy McDowall comes on board as Sam.  Also, the animation of scenery and sets is very good, though weaker with the characters.  Great liberties are taken with Tolkien's material.  Great honking abysmal liberties.The word 'travesty' may be a bit strong, but not by much.  I am generally a forgiving Tolkien fan, and indeed I enjoyed the animated Lord of the Rings directed by Bakshi just fine, but this is drek by a team that treated Tolkien as if he were just Jack Frost with hobbits.  For example, when he runs to Gandalf to let him know that Denethor is attempting suicide, Pippin yells, &quot;He's gone loony I tell ya!&quot;  I don't think you have to be a Tolkien geek to think that's just wrongThis film may appeal to the very young or the very deaf, but for anyone who has read the books, do yourself a favor and steer clear of this song-filled pillage of the 20th century's greatest work of literature.",2.0,0.7142857142857143,2,2,0.0,neutral,0.9927,very positive,2003,8,8

703160,B000067J13,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,1,3,2005-10-11,A Big Waste of Time,"""Happy Campers"" is a useful movie only because it prompts basic questions about its writer/director Daniel Waters and his breakout film ""Heathers"" (which he wrote but did not direct). Did he use up all his good stuff writing the Heathers screenplay and have nothing left for ""Happy Campers? Did he lose most of his active brain cells shortly after making Heathers (an event that would account for both the 'Hudson Hawk""and the ""Happy Campers"" screenplays)? Was Heathers just a happy accident? Or is Heathers so open-ended that critics and viewers attributed significance to a very ordinary movie. All these explanations are possible either jointly or collectively.For ""Happy Campers"" Waters tries to weave ""Breakfast Club"" themes into a ""Meatballs"" story. So you get tedious voice-over suggestions about how the artificial bounds of the high school hierarchy can sometimes be bridged by spending a couple months together as summer camp counselors. Like each detention server in ""The Breakfast Club"", each counselor is an easily identified stereotype. And over the course of camp each is supposed to go through changes, at least that appears to be the premise.Unfortunately the script has difficulty communicating this process despite an unprecedented amount of voice-over narration. All seven of the main characters get some voice-over time, a device that is very confusing and pretty much destroys any possibility of the movie having any unified theme.Dominique Swain has the biggest part as Wendy, the terminally peppy cheerleader type (appropriately pictured in a cheerleader outfit on the DVD). Swain is the only good thing about the movie, it is an over-the-top caricature that plays to her acting strengths. This is the type of role Swain should be playing, one that requires self-parody rather than subtlety. She also benefits by relative comparison to James (Jaime) King-whose acting skills are in the Kathy Ireland mold, as well as from being paired with the physically miscast Brad Renfro-who manages to drain all energy from each scene in which he appears. The other four counselors have a fair about of screen time and some lame misadventures but nothing particularly memorable.Some effort is made to introduce the actual summer campers to the story but none of it even remotely works. ""Meatballs"" was able to get away with shallow character development because it was basically just a Bill Murray vehicle. Although Swain might have been able to carry the whole thing like Murray the script does not allow this and things never really get going in ""Happy Campers"".Waters apparently believed that audiences would react positively to a movie where 90% of the comedy involved sexual references that most preteens would consider moronic. Hey Daniel, did you pay someone to write that Heathers"" screenplay for you.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",2.0,0.3333333333333333,2,1,-0.4215,negative,0.9953,very positive,2005,10,11

That's why my experience with this movie was so weird for me. I loved Adam Sandler in the movie but, in the end, the movie was totally let down by the story. Adam Sandler plays Barry Egan, a self employed business man who seems to be socially challenged (as well as fashion challenged) with 7 sisters and no brothers. It seems that he has been teased all of his life by his sisters and, as a result of this endless torment, he has depression issues as well as connection issues. Feeling lonely and vulnerable one night, he calls a sex line for some conversation and eventual release. Unfortunately for him, the sex line is run by a guy who black mails and extorts money from his ""more well off"" customers by threatening to reveal their ""perverted"" calls to the people around them (wives, girlfriends and business colleges). Barry, who seems to be a broken man; week and lifeless, meets a young lady named Lena Leonard, played by Emily Watson, through the help of one of his sisters. Emily becomes the woman of his dreams! Barry finds himself trying to win over Lena and at the same time hide from her the sex call debacle and to clear up any embarrassing things that his sisters might have said to her about him. It turns out that Lena (who is a little quirky herself) is the ideal woman for him and gives him a strength that he has never known. She is the catalyst that propels him from his inner prison. In theory this movie has allot to work with to make a great dark comedy, but in the end, it falls short. Adam Sandler really plays himself in this movie, but with a more serious approach, and I really enjoyed his performance. What I didn't like in this movie was some of the ""artsy visuals"" that were thrown in. For example, I'm still trying to figure out why a van filled with shady looking characters pull up, screeching, to his work parking lot and drop off a miniature piano!? In Magnolia these weird visuals worked, like in the end when it started to rain frogs. This represented one of the biblical plagues on man that God would put upon us when we are at our worst. I don't get the miniature piano reference, except they needed a way to introduce the piano because he (Adam Sandler) pays so much attention to it through out the movie. A garage sale purchase would have sufficed! Also, the Superbit release is a little bit of a mystery to me. The colors and sounds didn't seem, to me, to need a premium release.

Two primary threads are woven into the narrative, the first relating the efforts of one Mister Rimmin (Richard Lynch), who is in fact Astaroth a Grand Duke of Hell, to breed with a young woman, Jessica (Elyssa Davalos), who has been reared and protected by a coterie of Satanists from infancy through her 22nd year (the present), with an objective to produce a child that will rule the world in favour of The Forces Of Evil.  Since Satan and his court, whose acolytes are legion, may readily mate with any number of women at any time that they choose, there seems to be little point in Rimmin tarrying for Jessica.  However, such flaws in logic are matched with those of risible continuity issues.  The second principal theme in the plot is of the soap opera variety, a blithely groundless love affair between Jessica and a young man, Andy (Dack Rambo) whose romantic role in Jessica's life upsets the Duke of Darkness no end.  His attempts to interfere with the budding relationship of the young lovers is empty of those cunning components that are requisite for films of the ""Thriller"" genre.  The original television airing was for only 72 minutes, and the reason is revealed by an ongoing spate of orchestral crescendi along with fades indicating arrival of commercial interruptions.  The release in the DVD format adds about 25 minutes, with little overall improvement, because of uninspired parallel editing that fails to engage a viewer with either of the contrasting storylines.  There is even an exorcism here, in spite of its having little significant connection to the narrative but rather a bit more with the Friedkin film that it partially apes.  Direction seems to be unfocussed, and few able acting turns are to be found; nonetheless Richard Lynch, playing Astaroth as earthling, is impressive as ever.  The film ends abruptly, with some lead-in dialogue to subsequent chapters that did not occur, an unsatisfactory finish to a work that is rapidly paced, easy to watch, and easy to forget.  There are a good many such minor productions being reissued with fresh packaging to cash in on the burgeoning popularity of DVDs.

Even though he knows Daniel is still using drugs, still having random, unprotected sex, and still stealing and lying to support his habit. Even though he says Daniel smells bad, yet defiantly refuses to use deodorant. But regardless of Daniel's wretched body odour, Ryan can't stop having sex with Daniel long enough to throw him out. So Ryan begins a downward spiral. First losing his acting job. Then by participating in Daniel's promiscuity. And finally by doing drugs with one of Daniel's random tricks. In the last scene he appears to have died of an overdose.I wish I could say something nice about this film. But it suffers from a lack of direction. By that I mean, the director wasn't doing his job. Camera work was shaky and out of focus. Actors fumbled and stumbled over badly written lines. And it's really hard to say if there was enough sex to call this a porn film. But there were a lot of fragments of sex acts between pimply, greasy, decidedly un-sexy actors in decidedly un-sexy surroundings.

This is about as close to a plot as Triloquist comes to having, which isn't such a bad thing considering the film gets off to a very darkly humerous start, but sadly quickly loses steam once the road trip begins.  Still though, hottie LoPachin is clearly having a good time with the material, and turns in a surprisingly good and magnetic performance that will keep you interested in the flick, even when it degenerates into self-parody.

Happy Feet, ultimately an updated tale of the ugly duckling, tackles the sensitive issues of stigma and exclusion in a unique way.In this movie penguins sing. They have a soul voice and this gives them cultural identity. But when the lead character, Mumbles, is born with the gift of dance, he finds himself automatically ostracized from his emperor penguin community. What follows is a journey to right wrong and a challenge to discrimination.One of the flaws of Happy Feet is that you are never too sure who the intended target audience is: adults or children. Whereas traditional CGI movies (think any Pixar movie or Shrek et al) beguile the kids and tickle begrudging parents, Happy Feet wades in far too long and not too deep. My children (a five year old and a eight year old) began to lose interest once the novelty of singing and dancing penguins wore off. When I watched this in the cinema most children were meandering through the aisles. The truly painful rendition of Queen's classic 'Find Me Somebody to Love' didn't help matters.For me this movie is a little like crossing Moulin Rougue with the penguin biscuit commercial and unfortunately, despite the positve sentiment and clear message that to be different isn't necessarily a bad thing, left me cold and my children very bored.",2.0,0.5925925925925926,1,2,0.0,neutral,0.9529,very positive,2007,3,12

However, before I seen this film, I believed (and still do believe) that Clive Owen is an actor who can give a great performance, just watch Mike Nichols' ""Closer"" (one of the best films of 2004, in my opinion) to see how great of a performance he can give. Jennifer Aniston, on the other hand, had yet to impress me with her ""same character"" performances.""Derailed"" is about a man, Charles (Owen) and a woman, Lucinda (Aniston) who are both married, who meet on a train, and eventually fall in love with each other. So they wind up in a hotel, and decide to get a room, and then they begin to have an affair with each other. Soon after they get a room, they're interrupted by the bad guy, a french villian named Philippe (Vincent Cassel) who kick's Charles' butt, steals Charles' wallet, and leaves him unconscious, and then he decides to rape Lucinda. He decides to blackmail Charles, and Charles decides that the only way he can stop the bad guy from terrorizing him and his family, as well as keeping his affair a secret is by giving into Philippe's demands.Pros:-Jennifer Aniston has attempted to climb out of her ""Friends character"" shell, finally.-Those looking for a great popcorn movie, plenty of action, or violence will most likely be satisfied.-Excellent performances from Clive Owen and Vincent Cassel.-The rap stars performances in this film DO NOT RUIN THE MOVIE (for once).-Plenty of plot twists.-Good character development (especially Aniston's character).-You'll be cheering Clive Owen's character on in the last half hour of the film (and trust me, it's worth seeing).Cons:-The film's adverts practically give away the plot twists, so when you watch the film, you most likely know what is going to happen BEFORE it happens!-The film is too predictable, and if you want to enjoy most of the plot twists, chances are, you'll have to leave your brain at the door.-Jennifer Aniston's performance in the movie was somewhat difficult to believe, I felt like she was miscast.-Clive Owen looked like he could kick the french villian's butt at anytime, but instead, his character took all of the punches.-This movie would've been over in 15 minutes if Owen's character had a spine and common sense.-I couldn't believe all of the stuff Owen's character lets the bad guy get away with.-All Owen's character did around the bad guy was whimper and exclaim, ""Take all my money, please don't kill me"". COME ON! It's CLIVE OWEN!

However, I'm not writing this review to review the movie itself, I want to comment on this release.The Director's Expanded Edition of Last of the Mohicans is a real let down for me. First of all, I picked up this DVD at Wal-Mart as an impulse buy even though I already own it on VHS. When I saw ""Director's Expanded Edition"", I instinctually expected a multitude of special features, deleted scenes, added content, and digital quality to a movie I already place on my list of all time favorites. I really should have looked past the shiny foil box to look at what I was actually buying.First of all there are NO special features! NONE. NADA. ZIP. ZERO! Not a single feature. Not a ""making of"" special, not a single deleted scene or commentary, not even a trailer. A French audio track, Spanish subtitles, and an animated DVD menu is all the features you get with this DVD other than the feature itself. A real pity since this is a movie deserving of a behind the scenes featurette and perhaps some more features relating to the period. Especially given the feature itself was altered, you would think that there would be some added material from the director to highlight the changes (as was done with the Extended Edition of Gladiator, for example).Sadly, the lack of features isn't the only problem here. The feature itself is not the movie you and I all remember from the theater and from years of VHS existence. No. The director, in his infinite wisdom, has decided to re-edit the movie: thus, the ""Director's Expanded Edition"". From what I can tell, some material was added and some removed, and some tweaked around a bit. Now this is all well and good, but then at least tell us what you've done, where and why, and more importantly you BETTER give us the option to view either this new version OR the original theatrical version. No, this DVD breaks the cardinal rule of DVD directors cuts... it takes the option out of our hands of whether we liked it better BEFORE or NOW. Especially with a movie like this which is so loved by so many and has such a respected place in movie history (I would call it a modern classic), you had better let fans of the old version have the option of seeing it plain in addition to your ""improved"" version. Sadly... we got jipped.To add to the frustration, there isn't a ""regular"" edition even AVAILABLE right now in the U.S., so we're all stuck with the director's new judgment (which can't be that great if he had to change his mind about a movie that he made a decade ago and won so much praise in its previous state) unless we want to get a British copy (the British version is the original edition) and get a region-free DVD player. UGH! I HATE DVD politics. I'm tired of trying to find my favorite movies on DVD only to be confused by 4 different editions, or in cases like this getting jipped by not having ENOUGH choice. Sometimes I miss VHS, buying my movies was much simpler then... when no one really cared about features or audio formats or widescreen. But I digress.The bottom line is that if you want the original movie... you gotta get the VHS version or go British. Either that, or buy this version and see if you notice a difference... and mind not getting any extras. Either that... or wait until they release another edition. I hate to say it, but I wonder if maybe they just want to be able to re-release it again later, and get more of my money.",2.0,1.0,1,1,0.4019,positive,0.9907,very positive,2006,4,7

In some scenes, Brando manages to mimic Chaplin perfectly, and it works. In other scenes, he still mimics Chaplin, but the result is less effective. (As a devout Method actor, Brando repeatedly clashed with Chaplin, whose directorial style consisted of having the actors mimic his movements and delivery exactly). Sophia Loren is well-cast as the former Russian countess-turned-dance hall girl who stows away with the newly-appointed ambassador to Saudi Arabia (Brando). Aside from a major error in Chaplin's script (that is, that Loren's character is supposed to have left Russia in the revolution of 1917, which would make her character quite a bit older than she is), Loren plays the role with a comic grace that is both captivating and charming. The supporting cast have their moments: Sydney Chaplin as Brando's friend and advisor, Tippi Hedren as his estranged wife, Margaret Rutherford, in a delightful cameo as an elderly passenger aboard the ocean liner, and in a particularly memorable standout performance, Patrick Cargill as Brando's valet. Cargill shows a gift for comic timing and understated delivery here that makes the viewer wish he had been given more opportunities to demonstrate his talent. He nearly walks away with every scene he's in, and remains perhaps the most memorable part of the film.Chaplin's use of color and widescreen is appropriately understated in keeping with his style. However, it is in Chaplin's direction that we begin to see the limits of his filmmaking ability, at least in his later works. The cinematography is appropriately understated; however, it is in the editing that the pace of the film begins to bog down. Scenes requiring a frantic pace are edited entirely too slow, losing much of the comic rhythm between the performers. Many scenes are played out in single, long takes, without much interaction between the performers within the frame (they instead appear to have been instructed to stay ""on their mark"" and deliver their dialog).Perhaps the film's most memorable aspect is its lush orchestral score composed by Chaplin, and featuring the great ""This is My Song"", which re-appears throughout the film. Chaplin's abilities as a composer at this point had perhaps outmeasured his abilities as a filmmaker, and-fortunately for future audiences-he spent the next decade composing scores to his silent features of the 1920s.Universal's DVD of ""A Countess from Hong Kong"" is an excellent transfer in anamorphic widescreen. The colors are rich and the image sharp. It boasts a clear mono soundtrack, and features a trailer as an extra.",2.0,0.6923076923076923,1,1,0.0,neutral,0.997,very positive,2008,2,26

It seems that almost any movie I've seen that tries to have a ""save the Earth"" message comes across as preachy and heavy-handed.  ""Ferngully: The Last Rainforest,"" ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" James Cameron's ""Avatar,"" the horrible remake of ""Day the Earth Stood Still""... all of them seem to prefer beating us over the head with environmentalist propoganda over telling a decent story.  There are a few decent ones that manage to balance their message with a well-told story and likable characters (I'll get to those at the end of the review), but for the most part I've seen enough ""save the Earth"" films that favor preaching over quality that I instinctively cringe whenever the issue comes up in a movie.""The Lorax,"" based on one of my favorite Dr. Seuss books growing up, falls into the ""too preachy"" to be enjoyable category, and isn't helped by all the usual suspects when it comes to animated kids' films, especially kids' films based on children's books.The film takes place in Thneedville (a location not in the original book), an over-the-top city where everything is plastic and artificial, including the trees, and the air and water are so badly polluted that a child who goes swimming comes out glow-in-the-dark and the citizens must buy bottled air to live.  Our main character (nameless in the book, called Ted here) decides the best way to impress a girl he likes is to find an extinct, nearly-mythic object called a tree and give it to her.  Following his kooky grandmother's advice, he visits a crotchety recluse called the Once-ler, who tells him the sad story about how he destroyed Thneedville's environment despite the efforts of a guardian creature called the Lorax, and gives him the key to restoring the trees and repairing the damage he did.  The greedy, over-the-top mayor of Thneedville considers Ted's efforts a threat, however, and plots to thwart his plans...The original book is a classic, a bittersweet plea to take better care of our world and take responsibility for our actions.  In my honest opinion, it would have performed much better as a half-hour TV special than as a full-length movie, and padding the story's length with a romantic subplot, cartoony antics, and badly-written musical numbers (seriously, these are some the weakest songs I've heard in an animated movie since ""Quest For Camelot"") just makes it painfully obvious that there wasn't enough story to fill an hour and a half.  When will Hollywood learn that stretching a children's picture book into a feature-length movie rarely works?  (I'm looking at you, ""Polar Express"" and ""Ant Bully..."")The movie has all the attention span of a goldfish, with too-bright colors, characters that never seem to hold still, and an unrelenting pace that never pauses to let the viewer breathe and process what they've seen.  The characters are, with a few exceptions, either bland or just plain annoying.  Said exceptions are Ted's spirited grandmother (voiced quite appropriately by Betty White) and the bombastic mayor, an over-the-top villain who provides the most laughs in the film.  The title character himself suffers the worst, however -- he's reduced to a minor role, with Ted and the mayor hijacking the film, and he goes from a wise guardian character to a cranky wisecracker.  I also felt that Danny Devito's voice did not fit the original character, and that the character was rewritten to fit the actor, when it should have been the other way around.And yes, the film gets incredibly preachy, so much so that it becomes tiresome to watch.  It's possible to make a children's movie that has an environmental message without being terribly heavy-handed about it (such as WALL-E), but ""The Lorax"" manages to miss the mark.  It doesn't help that it was also a merchandise-driven film, which rather goes against its anti-materialistic message.While not an entirely terrible film, neither is this necessarily a good film.  It will entertain young children, I'm sure, but I imagine older children and most adults would quickly grow annoyed with it.  The fact that it butchers and pads out a beloved children's book doesn't help it either.For a better film that manages to carry its environmental message quite well without sacrificing storytelling, I recommend the aforementioned ""WALL-E"" or Miyazaki's ""Castle In the Sky"" or ""Nausicaa: Valley of the Wind.""  Or seek out the 2D animated ""Lorax"" special -- it's more faithful to the book.",2.0,0.5,1,5,-0.4019,negative,0.966,very positive,2013,2,14

He did as good a job as he could in this movie, but the storyline was lacking in more than one place.. At times, the dialogue between Leelee Sobieski and Chris Klein were so corny and outrageous, it almost made me sick. (At one point Klein actually names Sobieski's boobs after two Northeastern states...)I will say that recently, Klein has proven his great acting ability more than once (think ""We Were Soldiers"", ""American Pie"" 1 & 2), but in ""Here on Earth"" his acting was horrendous.I'm sure Sobieski is truly a wonderful person in reality, but so far, I've not found a movie of her's that I've liked. Accept for maybe ""Joy Ride"" which has her in only about 30-40% of the film (great movie, by the way).Josh Hartnett is as fabulous an actor as he's always been, but in this movie, his down to earth, humble, quiet, sensitive character is made out to be nothing more than a jealous, corruptive, possessive boyfriend.If they expect us to believe that Sobieski's character would choose Klein's rich boy ""Kelley"" over Hartnett's small town ""Jasper"", they should have cast someone more lovable than Hartnett to take Klein's place.

Early in the movie, some horse dealers come to a farm and offer to buy the farmer's horses, and they threaten to just take them if he won't sell.  The farmer has five strapping sons, and a good old fist fight breaks out, as the farmer and his boys defend their property -- it's choreographed for considerable comic effect (the youngest boy keeps getting knocked into the horse trough) and is reminiscent of the end of the barn-raising scene in ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.""  By the end of the movie, the farmer is standing by his wife's grave, telling her that she has company now -- three members of the family have joined her in the family plot.So this movie has all kinds of tonal problems, and the best one can say is that James Stewart, as Virginia farmer Charlie Anderson, is reasonably believable at any given moment, whether he's in his quasi-comic foxy patriarch mode, in his obsessed searcher mode, or in his grieving father/widower mode.  But all that doesn't add up to a character.  The action takes place late in the Civil War (after Gettysburg).  The wholesome family scenes, with their strong comic undertones just don't jive with the consequences of Anderson's decision to go after his youngest son (at whose birth Anderson's wife died) when he has been mistakenly taken prisoner by the Union Army -- he has been wearing a Confederate cap, and the Union captors reasonably assume that he's a Confederate boy soldier.  Anderson abhors slavery, but he also abhors war, and in a Confederate state, Virginia, he tries to remain isolated from it and get on with his farming.  Even his daughter's marriage to a young Confederate officer resolves itself in his mind to the question of whether the young man likes the girl.  He never raises with either the question of the rights and wrongs of the war, or of the implications of the fact that the South is clearly losing, or the issue of his son-in-law's feelings about slavery.  Are we to see Anderson as a naif, a kind of late-in-life Candide, who thinks that if he doesn't think about history, history won't bother with him?  Or is he the obsessed searcher seeking to keep his family together -- and in trying to do so, at least contributing to the violent deaths of three of them?  We see Anderson conversing in spirit with his late wife at her graveside, and Stewart does it well, but the questions of his judgment and possible culpability don't seem to enter his mind.There are some striking scenes -- the strongest might be the one where Anderson and his sons stop a train that is carrying Confederate prisoners so that they can find out if his son is among them.  He isn't, but by chance his son-in-law is!  The burning of the empty train is well filmed.  On the other hand, the following scene in which Anderson prepares a marriage bed in a deserted house so that his daughter's marriage can be consummated (while the rest of the family wait downstairs) is a bit cringe-inducing (the son-in-law had been summoned to report for duty right at the end of the wedding ceremony).The actors do their jobs, but the writing isn't strong enough to give the sons distinct characters. Rosemary Forsyth is attractively feisty as Anderson's daughter, and Katherine Ross hasn't much to do as his daughter-in-law except have a baby.  George Kennedy is a dignified Union General, to balance the son-in-law's decent Confederate officer.  The movie resolutely doesn't take sides -- so that the general ""war is hell"" message can get across in an uncomplicated kind of way.  But things aren't really that simple, and the movie avoids too much and sacrifices emotional coherence and credible characterization to boot.",2.0,0.0,2,3,0.0772,neutral,-0.9951,very negative,2014,6,2

Two primary threads are woven into the narrative, the first relating the efforts of one Mister Rimmin (Richard Lynch), who is in fact Astaroth a Grand Duke of Hell, to breed with a young woman, Jessica (Elyssa Davalos), who has been reared and protected by a coterie of Satanists from infancy through her 22nd year (the present), with an objective to produce a child that will rule the world in favour of The Forces Of Evil.  Since Satan and his court, whose acolytes are legion, may readily mate with any number of women at any time that they choose, there seems to be little point in Rimmin tarrying for Jessica.  However, such flaws in logic are matched with those of risible continuity issues.  The second principal theme in the plot is of the soap opera variety, a blithely groundless love affair between Jessica and a young man, Andy (Dack Rambo) whose romantic role in Jessica's life upsets the Duke of Darkness no end.  His attempts to interfere with the budding relationship of the young lovers is empty of those cunning components that are requisite for films of the ""Thriller"" genre.  The original television airing was for only 72 minutes, and the reason is revealed by an ongoing spate of orchestral crescendi along with fades indicating arrival of commercial interruptions.  The release in the DVD format adds about 25 minutes, with little overall improvement, because of uninspired parallel editing that fails to engage a viewer with either of the contrasting storylines.  There is even an exorcism here, in spite of its having little significant connection to the narrative but rather a bit more with the Friedkin film that it partially apes.  Direction seems to be unfocussed, and few able acting turns are to be found; nonetheless Richard Lynch, playing Astaroth as earthling, is impressive as ever.  The film ends abruptly, with some lead-in dialogue to subsequent chapters that did not occur, an unsatisfactory finish to a work that is rapidly paced, easy to watch, and easy to forget.  There are a good many such minor productions being reissued with fresh packaging to cash in on the burgeoning popularity of DVDs.

129664,0792157869,A2I4VTPKGSQZ75,3,16,2008-05-27,"Indiana Jones, Monty Python and the holy handgrenade of Antioch","For some reason, unbeknownst to me, quite a few people (and reviewers) dismissed the excellent ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" (also reviewed) as the worst sequel in the original 80's Indy series and some said it was just simply a bad film...full stop. They derided the film so much that I wondered if they had actually seen it at all, so unjust was the ""outrage"" against the episode. Obviously, the fact that ""Temple of Doom"" was following the truly wonderful ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (the only really great film of the 4) had a negative effect on how some were going to view the first sequel in the series, as no matter how hard Lucas and Spielberg et al tried they couldn't hope to top the incredible impact that ""Raiders"" had on the public.But unfortunately, it seems that the producers of the Indy series abandoned their own judgment and bent over backwards in an attempt to eliminate the darker elements of ""Temple of Doom"" and replace it with lashings of incredibly stupid and inane comedy for the third installment, ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"".So vehement were the producers of ""Last Crusade"" to replace serious content with appalling idiocy, they were willing to litter the movie with slapstick nonsense that destroyed the overall film.Of course, that doesn't mean that the film is a complete write off in every department. The basic story is OK (but only just) and sees our hero following in his fathers obsessive quest for the famed cup of Christ, or the Holy Grail. The essential plot elements are all there and includes the usual Indy staples of multiple locations, deadly traps and spectacular supernatural McGuffin. Even the Germans were forced back into their nazi uniforms to don their traditional Hollywood caricature as the badguys; Which, in my opinion was a bit tired and un-necessary. There are plenty of bad folk around and their presentation here is far, far inferior than their turn in ""Raiders"".Most in the movies favor, and the only reason this film gets an extra star, is the inclusion of Sean Connery as Indy's dad. It's a good plot device to hang the kinda weak central plot onto and Connery's performance as the bungling Old Man of Henry Jones Jr is quite delightful and he has some great lines too...""We named the dog Indiana"".The shared screen time of Ford and Connery generally works well and they pair of them seemed to be having a good time in their roles.Another mention should go to Irish actress Alison Doody, as the obligatory squeeze (with a twist) and Denholm Elliott who reprises his charming role as Marcus Brody, dean of Indy's college in America. Unfortunately, it was to be for the last time.Also of note, is a floppy haired River Phoenix as a young Indiana in the movies brilliant opening sequence.Unfortunately, after the opening is complete, the film starts to go rapidly downhill until it naturally reaches it's ridiculously absurd climax, by which time my suspension of disbelief had had enough and Mr Cynicism had stepped in.But even the rapidly disintegrating story would have been bearable if Spielberg and Lucas had refrained from carelessly dropping the incredibly unfunny attempts at ""humour"" through the film. Sure, the two preceding efforts had liberal amounts of humour sprinkled within it's opening and ending credits, but it remained subtle and never interfered with the overall product or the ""seriousness"" of the piece. In ""Raiders"" Indy shoots the sword wielding foe with his revolver, instead of fighting him with a sword and in ""Temple of Doom"" he tries it again, but this time his gun has been missing since the opening sequence. These humourous efforts are fine and funny and what's more they are limited to reality. They don't break down the walls of reality and destroy the suspense or action of a given scene.Whereas the ""humour"" in the ""Last Crusade"" is so heavy handed that it completely ruins a scene. For instance, when Indy breaks his way through a library floor in Venice to get to a secret chamber, the noise he naturally makes breaking the floor is mistaken by a librarian for the noise he makes while he is stamping overdue books. Now, this may be fine in a Monty Python movie, but in a film such as an Indy adventure, it is just stupid. There's no other words for it. It ruins the suspense of the scene.Likewise the ""No Ticket"" scene in the Zeppelin and the ridiculous Berlin book burning scene where Indy meets Hitler, coupled with the scene where the BF108 pilot sheers his wings off and continues traveling down a tunnel beside a car containing the Jones boys go a long way towards tearing apart any suspension of disbelief that's required equipment for watching a film of this sort. It's unbelievably groan making, destroys the suspense and danger and it's difficult to imagine anyone finding it enjoyable.At it's conclusion ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" has long since revealed itself another 'could have been' film. It could have been great, but it's let down terribly by the decision to dilute the overall effect with mind numbing idiocy and it kills any excitement with dreadful foot stamping comedy that even a Will Ferrell movie would scoff at.",2.0,0.1875,1,2,0.0,neutral,-0.9956,very negative,2008,5,27

She plays Rachael a lawyer who is struggling to find happiness and meaning in her life as she enters her 30's.  Kate Hudson who hasn't made a good film since Almost Famous plays Darcy, Rachael's lifelong best friend who is engaged to her law school friend Dex played by Colin Egglesfield.  John Krasinski plays Ethan, Rachael & Darcy's childhood friend.  The film focuses on Rachael & Dex finally realizing they were meant for each, having an affair and ending up together in the end.

I'm not sure what, if anything, that says about Ms. Judd's personal life, but it does make many of her performances schadenfreude-style treats when consumed on the big screen. And the first thirty-odd minutes of Sandra Nettlebeck's Helen are described perfectly by this. Unfortunately, the movie runs two hours.Plot: Helen (Judd) and David (ER's Goran Visnjic) are a seemingly happy couple whose life couldn't be better--that is, until Helen begins changing. It's not much of a spoiler to tell you that she's sliding into depression (like I said, this stage of the film is its first quarter, give or take). And we're not talking rainy-day blues here, we're talking crippling, life-threatening depression. She eventually hits bottom and deserts her family--and her doctor--to bond with Mathilde (Lie with Me's Lauren Lee Smith), a similarly-affected former student of hers, while David tries to figure out what went wrong and how to make it better.It's impossible to get into the meat of why the last three-quarters of the movie don't work without what some may consider spoilers, though they have to do with the experience of depression rather than things specific to the film, so I will throw in a spoiler alert here and let the reader beware. The problem is that ""what went wrong"" is, as will be instantly recognizable by anyone who has lived through this kind of depression or lived with someone who has lived through this kind of depression, the wrong question entirely to be asking. I have no doubt that was Nettlebeck's point; the problem is that if her intention was to portray the ineffectual nature of David's quest leading to almost causing his own breakdown, she perhaps did it too well, as watching it is almost as frustrating as living it. One review I read of the film recently said this is a lesson as much as it is a movie. Indeed. And the didactic nature is liable to grate on anyone who already knows the answer.Still, Ashley Judd's performance in the first part of this movie does make this worth watching, though I think you'd be forgiven for deciding to turn it off halfway through. **",2.0,0.0,12,1,0.1531,neutral,-0.9909,very negative,2013,4,26

Okay, Arnold is not the greatest actor to ever grace the screen, but he usually makes great, suspend-disbelief-and-they-are-entertaining  movies.  Gabriel Byrne is a great actor and usually appears in good movies.  Kevin Pollack plays a side-kick as well as anyone and is good comic  relief.  Between the three of them, you would have hoped that one of them  would have read this script and said, &quot;Oh My God, this story is REALLY  BAD!&quot;The plot of this movie is predictable and so full of logical  holes that it makes one wonder if anyone actually wrote it or if they just  started filming a bunch of &quot;cool&quot; action and occult scenes and  thought putting it all together would make a good movie.  The Devil is  alternately brilliant and stupid.  Arnold somehow manages to outsmart the  Prince of Darkness and the New York Police Department, despite being an  alcoholic burn-out.  And, after watching this movie I am still confused as  to who Arnold and Kevin actually work for.  As for the number of the beast  being 999 instead of 666 and that being why Satan has to mate in 1999, I am  still confused as to what happened in the year 999.  Wouldn't that have  been the end of the thousand years they kept babling about in this movie?  Did the Devil run into an ancient version of Arnold and get his butt kicked  then, too?  And if so, why didn't he learn?In addition to the cast  already mentioned, this movie also has other good actors who should have  known better.  Robin Tunney (great in &quot;The Craft&quot;), Rod Stieger  (&quot;On the Waterfront&quot;), Anthony Fultz (&quot;For Love of the  Game&quot;) and CCH Pounder (&quot;Face Off&quot;) are all wasted in this  suprisingly bad movie.Don't get me wrong.  I can suspend disbelief with  the best of them, and I know movies are supposed to be entertainment and  not reality.  But, at some level, the movie must make sense and fill in the  blanks.  This movie seems to be just a vehicle for Arnold to kick Satan's  ass.

These films have the distinct honor of being the first Dracula films in color, but offer little else. Hammer was working on an incredibly low budget when they made these films, and it shows.The directing and acting is all pretty solid for these films. Christopher Lee's Dracula has become nearly as iconic as Lugosi's, but in the beginning he comes off a bit dry (Horror of Dracula) but he catches his stride with the other films using his distinctive and imposing voice. Also Lee doesn't have many lines in any of these films, and his role gets smaller and smaller with each new film.The budget has an averse effect on a number of aspects of the film. All of the costumes look like they were taken from the wardrobe from a High School play, certainly not something you'd see in a major motion picture. Even Dracula looks like he's wearing a cheap Halloween costume, complete with cheesy makeup. Dracula can't transform (likely would've cost too much for the effects). The blood is really bright, and looks a lot more like paint or tomato juice. What few effects they try to make is very poorly done, using a series of fade away effects that are blurry and just plain ugly. The best effect is in the finale of Horror of Dracula. The sets suffer for this as well. The interior of Dracula's Castle for instance looks like a terrible cheap stage (again, like it was ripped from a high school play). It lacks all of the character and detail Universal's classic had.The story in the films has been changed significantly from any previous incarnations of Dracula (to the point of which it's almost a new film). As I mention Dracula's shapeshifting is gone, in these films his only powers are hypnotism and his immortality. Many of the names have been switched around, and many of the basic elemets are recycled throughout each of the films (almost to the point of which it feels like you've been watching the same movie over and over). Each movie is packed with tons of B-Movie cheese, if you're into that stuff.The exception would be Dracula 1972 A.D. which is packed with 70's disco super cheese. It's really, really bad. If you grew up in the 70's it will probably be a great nostalgia trip. For the rest of us, it's painful. Even if you're into the usual low-budget fair then the last film may prove to be just that bad.In the end it boils down to this. The films aren't as good as the classic Universals, but they are in color. They also aren't as good as the more recent Dracula films (except perhaps for the Dracula 2000 series). It's really a set for collectors only, members of the large cult following.

Boy was I in for a surprise! To be sure, it was different, just not in a good way. Had the film been more aptly titled (something like ""Jack Goes to Sleep"" or even ""Jill Had the Good Sense to Clear Out Long Before They Made This Turkey""), a couple hours of my life that I will never get back certainly would have been better spent.Dull character, dull dialogue and - spoiler alert! - dull plot. In your typical romantic comedy, you KNOW the guy is going to get the girl in the end, but the whole reason for watching is finding out how the two overcome numerous and improbable difficulties to become one in the forgone conclusion. Now don't get me wrong, the last thing the world needs is ANOTHER romcom; I'm merely pointing out that formula does produce the occasional flick worth watching. ""Jack Goes Boating"" messes with that formula on several levels. It's short on both romance and comedy, and long on, well, being long. Middle-aged and dysfunctional Connie is frigid in a lukewarm sort of way. Her paramour, the middle-aged and dysfunctional Jack, is socially inept and sports the homeless look, which is curious, considering his profession as a limo driver. Early in the movie, Jack hooks up with Connie, and there's never any reason for them to break up, so they don't. That's the story, with some padding and a subplot not worth going into here. Really, the whole thing could have been comfortably fit into a 90-second trailer. To beef up this paltry scrap into a full-length feature, the filmmakers show Jack learning how to swim and taking cooking lessons. One action-packed scene has Jack filling out a job application AND submitting it to a prospective employer! In the spirit of public service, the fimmakers use ""Jack Goes Boating"" as a vehicle to point out the rather obvious - an unintended consequence of drug use can include burnt casserole. Perhaps most surprisingly, our new couple overcomes their sexual difficulties when Connie talks Jack into raping her! I know, I know, I know, it sounds crazy (but it's true, smoking hash really can be the death of an otherwise perfectly good dinner).And that, folks, is ""Jack Goes Boating."" Problem is, my review makes the movie sound more interesting than it really is.Somewhere in ""Jack Goes Boating"" there probably is some good filmmaking and solid acting.

I believe that a lot of fans breathed a sigh of ""finally"" when they heard the project was under way.  And Frank Darabont has had a decent track record with King movies, if a short track for sure.  Still, they had a great ensemble cast, lead by Thomas Jane, and with cgi in full swing these days, this film had the potential of becoming a modern day science-fiction classic, in the same way that B-films like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", and ""The Quatermass X-periment"" have become undeniable classics over the years.I asked my teenage daughter to go with me, for she too is a Stephen King fan, and I knew we were going to see something special.  About halfway through the film, I was marveling at how Darabont had gotten it down right, how good it felt, dark and frightening, otherwordly and atmospheric.  I knew the story, I'd read it so many times, because I frankly love this sci-fi/horror adventure, like I love Bradbury's Fahrenheit-451, or John Cambell's ""Who Goes There"", so I knew there were no surprises that a fifteen year old shouldn't see.  I was enjoying myself so much, that I was already planning to ask other people to go to it, just so I had an excuse to see it again.  And even acknowledged that I'd be buying this movie on DVD as soon as it was available.And then when it happened in the last seven minutes of the film, when all the preceding story was mocked and destroyed in a kind of low-blow, cosmic joke, in which the main characters all decided to act against character, to step out of the classic story arc, and destroy a wonderfully paced film by turning it into a cynical existencial joke on mankind, I kept thinking, 'No way, they are not going to do this.  They can't.' But they did, and I sat there stunned, muttering, ""I can't believe they did this.  They've ruined it.""  I'd waited all these years, since I first read the novella in 1983, for this film, and they ruined it. My daughter looked at me and said exactly what I was thinking, ""I thought he would wake up and it would be a nightmare, but he didn't"".I won't spoil the ending for you, because it can't be spoiled any more so than watching does on its own.  If you want to know before you go to see the film, it's all over the place now, written in movie reviews and on blogs.I've read many comments from film goers that liked or 'loved' the new twist ending, but my feeling is they never read or appriciated the original story.  There are just as many, and maybe a little bit more, of us who absolutely hated the ending.  And we know it's because that's not how it ended in the novella.  We know that David Drayton's character would not have ended the story that way.  There just is absolutely no indication that he had that character attribute at any time in the preceding story.  Not one hint.  You just don't do that in good story-telling.I read somewhere that Darabont sent that change in the script to Stephen King and he said something like, ""I wish I'd thought of that ending"".  I can tell you that it is my experience that fiction editors do not like dark, cynical endings unless they are hinted at in the preceding story, and if King had written The Mist with the ending that is now in the film version forever, The Mist in novella form would most likely never have seen print.  I kind of wish it hadn't now, then I wouldn't have wanted a film version so badly.  In any case, I went from wanting to see The Mist again and again, and to wanting to buy the DVD, to never wanting to see the movie again.

These things challenge the imagination, make one wonder and dream, and, if one is lucky, to discover one's strengths, whilst imagining fighting the powers of evil and defending the powers of good, one's self.  Studying the history of witchcraft, and imagining oneself a witch or warlock, brings challenges: what, if anything, WOULD I do for power?  Would I be a good witch / warlock, or an evil one?  Use my powers for good or for bad?  (In the real world, ""power"" is often defined by money -- but the choice of the usages of this ""power"" -- for good or for evil -- amounts to the same thing, really....)Not that I don't like humour mixed in with stories of witchcraft.  Although ""Dark Shadows"" remains my favourite fantasy program, I still have a warm spot for ""Bewitched"", as well.  ""Bewitched"", for all it's sometime-shortcomings of posturing and sometimes-hackneyed dialogue, had, in the main, quite good dialogue, sharply drawn characters, often with full-three dimensional feelings, and acting and actors that took the stories -- even the sometiems silly stories -- quite seriously.""Sabrina The Teenage Witch"", however, rarely took itself seriously.  If 10% of ""Bewitched""'s stories and dialogue were silly and/or hackneyed, and 90% of the storylines quite serious, (even in humourous stories) -- ""Sabrina The Teenage Witch"" was just the opposite: 10%, (barely), of serious story-line, and 90% bad dialogue, and silly -- if not downright stupid -- situations.  The dialogue reminds one the worst writings of the most untalented of Junior High School English classes.  I don't know if the same people wrote it-- but the writing of ""Sabrina The Teenage Witch"" reminds me, sadly, of the 'go-for-cheap-laughs' writing in at least one other program, 'Hannah Montana'.  Where is the writing style I loved so much in the original ""Land of the Lost"" TV series, in '90210', and in 'Sweet Valley High' (whose writing-style -- witty and assertive -- was the best writing of all?)The actors and actresses on this program TRIED to make their characters realistic -- but this was impossible with characters who were caricatures to begin with.  The storylines continued on this vein.  Where ""Bewitched"" was a comedy, ""Sabrina The Teenage Witch"" was, in the main, merely a farce.Nowhere was this more evident than in the show's last season, where it was obvious the writers were looking desparately for new story venues, and Melissa Joan Hart no longer looked like a teenager.Truly, I enjoyed -- and got more out of -- the ANIMATED series of ""Sabrina The Teenage Witch"", than I did this live-action sit-com.  I was extremely disapointed in what COULD so easily have been a nice comedy with serious overtones, about a teenager torn between her family's witchcraft heritage, and her desire to be a normal person.I have sadly nicknamed this series: ""Sabrina The Teenage Disappointment"".  I eagerly await the DVDs of the complete series of 'Sweet Valley High', (only the first season has been published so far.)  The dialogue and story-lines of ""Sabrina The Teenage Witch"" bring to mind the current 're-writing' of the classic Nancy Drew books.  Writing and plot-lines are now being 'simplified'.  To what end?So our population will gradually forget how to think and evaluate?My advice is to look elsewhere for imaginative entertainment.  As the series now stands, ""Sabrina The Teenage Witch"" casts a mind-emtying spell on all who view it.And nowhere is this more evident than in the last, (desperate) season of the series.",2.0,0.125,2,1,0.0,neutral,0.9348,very positive,2011,3,4

Did I miss the point when I left ""Tron: Legacy"" feeling it was a monumental failure as a story? If I'm to continue with this review, I must first make it clear that I don't see the ""Tron"" films in the same way a lot of people do. I don't believe they deserve praise simply for their innovative special effects; I personally require an engaging plot, character development, and the sense that it's operating under a heightened but nonetheless understandable set of rules. In other words, I like a good sci-fi/fantasy film, but not when all effort is put into visuals and absolutely nothing is put into the screenplay. If that makes me a prude who wouldn't know a cool movie even if it came up and bit me, feel free to stop reading and start searching the web for a more enthusiastic review.Just like its 1982 predecessor, watching ""Tron: Legacy"" is a little like watching a demo reel from the visual effects department - all flash and bang but no substance. It makes not the slightest effort to be plausible or consistent, it freely glosses over glaring technicalities, the dialogue is unbelievably awkward, and the performances are wasted on characters with no depth. The plot is convoluted and impenetrable, and it seems the more it tries to explain, the less sense it makes. The entire concept of people living inside a computer is a logistical nightmare, but if I start rattling off a list, I fear I might not be able to stop. Its greatest offense is not having any audience in mind other than the original film's fan base, which, when you think about, hardly seems big enough to have warranted a sequel in the first place.I will admit that the film is a dazzling sight to behold. I was especially impressed with work done on the character of Clu, a hacking program; he was designed to look exactly like his creator, Kevin Flynn, but since people age and computer programs do not, it was necessary to digitally reconstruct the face of Jeff Bridges as it appeared over twenty years ago. The results are uncannily convincing. With just a little more development, we may someday see digital recreations of bygone Hollywood icons and not notice a difference. Imagine it - Humphrey Bogart acting alongside Ingrid Bergman in a sequel to ""Casablanca.""Since the events of the first film, Flynn got married, had a son, became a widower, and was promoted to CEO of a computer corporation called ENCOM International. He disappeared in 1989, leaving behind his son, Sam, and vague promises of a cutting edge digital revolution, one he claimed would forever change science, medicine, and religion. The story begins twenty years later, when a now twenty-seven-year-old Sam (Garrett Hedlund) breaks into ENCOM headquarters, distributes their newest operating system over the internet for free, uploads a virus into their mainframe, and escapes by jumping off the rooftop and releasing a parachute he just happened to have stowed away on his person. After his arrest and release, Sam is approached by ENCOM's consultant and Flynn's old friend Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner), who says he received a page from Flynn's office, the number of which has been disconnected for twenty years. So help me God, the man is still using a pager.Upon entering his father's abandoned arcade, Sam discovers a secret room with a miraculously functional computer and a fully operational laser; with a few careless strokes of the keyboard, Sam is zapped with light and transported into the computer world, known as the Grid. We then witness must have been an homage to the sepia-tone-to-Technicolor transition shown in ""The Wizard of Oz""; the film shifts from 2D to 3D, which is a new one on me. Sam is immediately captured by electronically-voiced guards in black suits with glowing orange stripes. After being stripped of his earthly clothes, fitted with a black suit with glowing blue stripes, and linked with a memory-storing disc that doubles as a Frisbee, he's pitted against Flynn's program, Clu (Jeff Bridges), who has since turned evil. He's then forced to participate in games of survival, including a race on digital motorcycles that trail light behind them. He's rescued by a program named Quorra (Olivia Wilde) and driven away from the city into the surrounding mountains. Mountains. In a computer grid. And there are clouds in the sky, too.I will now stop describing the plot and move on to some of the little things that drove me mad. There's a house stocked with furniture, physical paper books, and food. I must assume it's not some digital replication, for Sam is able to eat it without a problem. There's a club high atop a sky rise in the heart of the computer city, where a program played by Michael Sheen struts around with a cane and speaks like a Dr. Frank N. Furter wannabe. There's an ending which begs the question of how anything created in a computer could ever exist in the physical human world. After all, it's all just a bunch of immaterial zeros and ones. The fact that I'm fixated on this when I'm supposed to be enjoying myself should tell you everything you need to know. ""Tron: Legacy"" is a horrendous miscalculation, one of the least understandable films to come along in quite some time.",2.0,0.2954545454545454,7,2,0.0,neutral,0.99,very positive,2010,12,17

I have found out that this film was apparently based on a novel, I would recommend without reading it to stick with the novel. Seeing this movie was my wife's idea, and I was reluctant simply because I had heard nothing about this movie (good or bad) and didn't know what it was. I wanted to see Hellboy, now I wish I had, even if it meant letting my wife trod off to see this disaster by herself.It seems that the idea behind the movie was to parody fairy tales, offering a sort of ""Cinderella with a twist"" sort of tale. Many elements of the parody seem ripped from the drastically better ""Shrek"" including the oppression of mystical creatures, elves, Ogres, etc seemed very reminiscent of Lord Farquad's activities in the first Shrek. The big difference between Ella Enchanted and Shrek is that Ella Enchanted is not really funny. I found myself rolling my eyes, smacking my forehead, and playing Mystery Science Theater despite my wife's slugging me very hard in the arm. Sadly the only laughs this movie garnered from the audience were when I did my Simon Cowell impersonation and commented on Ann Hathaway's song and dance routine. This movie wants to be Shrek, meets Cinderella, meets A Knights Tale, but lacks the humor and subtlety of Shrek, the intrigue of a good Cinderella (al la Ever After) and the charm of A Knights Tale. In short, this is the worst interpretation of Cinderella I have ever seen. I cannot comment on the book from which this movie draws its inspiration, but I can say that this film certainly offers little incentive to actually read it. My wife liked it, but mentioned its not a buy worthy movie. I would think that the only audience who might like to buy this film (Pardon my generalizing)would be 13-year-old girls (probably the film's target audience). The film contains a hunky guy whose perfect in every way, IQ-taxing humor, and poor special effects along side a cheesy stereotypical ""Cinderella"" romance story that only a 13-14 year old girl (or younger) could enjoy. The film contains nothing for older audiences, and nothing for well... guys... And that's okay, there's plenty of guy movies out there (like Hellboy). The rest of us would have to fight the urge to Play Mystery Science Theater and mock this film. An urge I could not resist.

So when I heard the reviews of this film being so cruel when it first came out, I was thinking, &quot;Who cares, I'll probably like it just fine.&quot;But unfortunately, I don't.The premise of the order sounds fine. A mystery being called the Sin Eater goes around absolving people of their sins, but also killing people while it does so. So the Vatican Church has to send in its tactical strike squad (sounds like it could be something out of a Dan Brown book), aka Heath Ledger playing a young priest, to go destroy this Sin Eater; after all, the Sin Eater is horning in on church business here facilitating the relationship between Jesus and man in redemption. They can't have that.I have always been fascinated with the idea of priests as something like holy warriors fighting the forces of darkness, be it &quot;The Exorcist&quot; or comic books. This film unfortunately doesn't do much with the idea.First, let me say that the atmosphere set is very dark and Romantic (capital R), and I was pleased with it. You have every thing you'd expect from a movie like this - solemn priests, graveyards, ancient churches, demons, ravens, candle-light, a hushed air of mysterious menace - very fine stuff. The lighting is wonderfully evocative, and the sets and the costumes are all well done in my opinion.But little else is good. The acting... this is just my opinion, but it feels like little effort was put into the acting. The lines are delivered perfunctorily, with competence, yet I'm not really buying into it. Which was a shame, because I did want to. Heath Ledger in particularly was a big disappointment because generally I like his work. I thought Shannyn Sossamon was very fetching (She'd make me re-think my priestly vows) in an interesting role where she plays Ledger's &quot;love interest&quot; so to speak, an artist who was possessed in the past and even now may very well be quite disturbed.The pacing of the plot is bad. The movie stumbles and lurches, and doesn't ever really pick up. When you get right down to it, the story is threadbare and doesn't have a lot to work with it. Finally, I won't give anything away, but the last third or so of the movie is pretty terrible. Even halfway through the movie I was still optimistic, but I just thought toward the end it got really boring, contrived, and even ridiculous.The DVD extras aren't anything to write home about. Trailers, commentary, and some deleted scenes that actually really did add nothing and deserved to be cut.

Tolkien wrote 4 books -- The Hobbit and its sequel, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, made up of The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King -- which together tell the story of the resurfacing and the destruction of the One Ring of Power wielded by Middle Earth's evil nemesis, Sauron.  The animated trilogy consists of The Hobbit and two films that should divide the trilogy in half, Lord of the Rings and The Return of the King, though so much material and so many characters are written out that they bear scant resemblance to the source material.  To further complicate matters, The Hobbit and The Return of the King are produced and directed by Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass, the team that brought to television almost every holiday classic that concerns Santa Claus, Frosty, Rudolph or the Easter Bunny, while the second film, The Lord of the Rings, was directed by Raph Bakshi.  Confused yet?  It's important to remember these facts because, other than catering to your need to be comprehensive, you will most likely enjoy Bakshi's effort but should run from the other two as if hellhounds were on your tail.There is so much missing here (including dropping major characters that were in the second instament!) that you will never comprehend the story as written by Tolkien, and even more importantly, the ubiquitous songs are SO plentiful, SO saccharin and SO dated that you may damage your fingers trying to fast forward through them all. DVD extras are slim -- textual screens about Tolkien, Middle Earth and the cast &amp; crew that were on the previous disks.Voice talent is good:  John Huston narrates and plays Gandalf, Orson Bean repeats as Bilbo and Frodo, and Roddy McDowall comes on board as Sam.  Also, the animation of scenery and sets is very good, though weaker with the characters.  Great liberties are taken with Tolkien's material.  Great honking abysmal liberties.The word 'travesty' may be a bit strong, but not by much.  I am generally a forgiving Tolkien fan, and indeed I enjoyed the animated Lord of the Rings directed by Bakshi just fine, but this is drek by a team that treated Tolkien as if he were just Jack Frost with hobbits.  For example, when he runs to Gandalf to let him know that Denethor is attempting suicide, Pippin yells, &quot;He's gone loony I tell ya!&quot;  I don't think you have to be a Tolkien geek to think that's just wrongThis film may appeal to the very young or the very deaf, but for anyone who has read the books, do yourself a favor and steer clear of this song-filled pillage of the 20th century's greatest work of literature.",2.0,0.7142857142857143,2,2,0.0,neutral,0.9927,very positive,2003,8,8

That was disappointing.,"This is a slick film coming from an interesting place, Iceland, filled with sorta cute people (of both genders) and some interesting family dynamics, and the main plot circles around a sports star.  This film had lots of potential.In a nutshell, the central figure, an Icelandic soccer (""football"") star, Ottar, decides to come out as gay in order to be on the ""front page"" of a magazine.  This leads to problems, as the Icelandic people are evidently quite homophobic, and Ottar is sent packing, his family is enraged/horrified, his son ostracized, and his wife/girlfriend/son's mother is driven further into her liquor-induced semi-coma.Fortunately, there is another soccer team which is more accepting, and Ottar decides to give it a try on a new team, essentially forming a team of gay and gay-friendly men who become quite successful, mostly because nobody else will play them.This film fails, mostly, because of a flaw in the story.  You never get the chance to know or like Ottar beyond the plain facts that he is an attractive, spoiled, self-centered egotistic dummy who does whatever he wants without really thinking his actions or their consequences through.  As such, it's hard to generate much emotional investment in his welfare or the conflicts in the story.  The supporting characters are equally shallow, and you are left with little to watch.Beyond this flaw, the story wanders all over the place, the resolution is still-born, the dialog is filled with witty banter like ""shut up,"" and the sum of the parts is unspectacular.Ironically, there is a trailer for ""Guys & Balls,"" on this DVD, which is a German film with a very similar plot, done with much more style and grace (and humor) which is far more worth your time.

In the book the oldest girl was supposed to be 12 when they came to the attic, in the movie she looks 15 or 16. In the book the grandmother didn't cut the oldest girls hair, she tried but Chris stopped her. And what happened to the incest? It carried such huge messages and themes in the book and in the movie there is none of it. I could go on for pages about the inconsistensies, even the ending is hugely different. I swear sometimes when they actually said something from the book I would think &quot;Hey! That's kinda like Flowers In The-...oh yeah...&quot;. But to defend the makers of this movie a bit, this was before the entertainment industry relized how much it annoys people when they don't follow much loved books. I mean look at the 2 latest movies based on books, Lord Of The Rings and Harry Potter. They are two great books with movies that are good as well and stay true to them. I really wish they would remake the movie and have a movie for each book in the series. I think Flowers In The Attic was around 400 pages. When a 400 page book is squashed into an 85 minute movie it isn't pretty...But for a moment here lets forget about the book, now lets look at the problems with the stand alone movie. The acting was quite weak at times. Cory's voice was annoying but I actually respected that because it seemed more realistic. Another thing I like about the movie was how it showed that man digging the four graves, that was a very eerie well done scene. A shame it was only 4 seconds and the rest of the movie never had that eerie mood. A movie like this really should have that eerie mood. It all happened too fast. And you never got to know the characters well enough to feel bad for them. You never got to know the mother well enough to be shocked when the truth came out. Nothing was understood, there seemed to be a shortage of lines. And half the lines were chocked full of emotion that came to soon and too rushed. Instead of getting the feeling they were in the attic for years, you feel they were in the attic for 85 minutes, the time of the movie. It doesn't glide you from scene to scene, it puts more circles under the childrens eyes and tell you it's been a few months. And by skipping those few months we lose a lot of important dialoge and emotions that must have passed between the children.

Keel's book on the events. &quot;The Mothman Prophecies&quot; alas, is a movie that wanders completely away from the original story and decides to update it in a puzzling, boring way. The original events, some consider them real others a hoax, took place in 1966, the movie updates the story to 2002 and adds it's own spin on things. This would be fine if the script had been crafted a little better, but instead it wanders around in circles.

At least the original book has it's own explanations, and no matter how out of this world they might seem, they are still explanations. In the film for example, Richard Gere's wife dies as a result from a car crash they were involved in soon after spotting the Mothman, and she begins to draw visions of the creature on paper, ok, interesting. But later in the film no connection is established between her death and the Mothman, in fact, nothing connects in this movie. What exactly are the Mothman Prophecies?

At times, the cinematography looks like a 1960s TV show. To be fair, the NYC sets from the early 1900s look interesting, though they are obviously sets, not locations. I wasn't fooled into believing I was watching 1930s NYC either. It looks more like 1900 at times. The anachronisms can be distracting.

The review inside was on the mediocre side, but I thought for the right price I would give it a shot.  I did.  I was bored.  I fell asleep.  I restarted and finished the flick and wished I hadn't wasted the sixteen bucks!!!!!This is the ideal type of film for someone like me.  It's a love letter to the monster movies of the mid 80's.  Full of sex, nudity, graphic violence, rediculous plots....but done with felt puppets ala a really low rent version of The Muppets.  This should've been a time specific funny black movie on the level of Peter Jackson's brilliant Meet the Feebles.  It's not.  The jokes are bargain bin used and not very ambitious above bodily humor and cheap sex jokes.  All of these would be fine in my book if there were other types of jokes and they were more clever. They're not.  They stay the same and the same they are.  Over and over again for one hour and ten minutes.Also, I found the staging to be quite boring.  Literally, one puppet talks and then we cut to another and they talk.  Over and over and over again.  The film is very visually stale which is weird, despite it's low budget, they only had puppets that could do anything, and computer generated backgrounds that could be anything.  I've made really low budget films and they looked more visually stimulating than this.The puppet designs with the exception of the film's alien-like monster are all pretty dull.  There are no real characters but rather cliche'd characters from the 80's slasher movie character store.  Again, this would be all good if the filmmakers took a stand or a funny edge to them, but they don't.  The plot is a mix between Mad Monster Party, Ali?n, and House on Haunted Hill(either original or remake), so why not go more out of control.  This movie oddly keeps its characters and plot very stale as opposed to doing something crazy or wild like Meet the Feebles or even Team America.  Despite the wacky premise this film is very 'safe'.I appreciate what the film was trying to do, and I love the idea of the film using puppets, but this is no masterpiece unfortunately.  The dvd itself has only a couple of special features.  First we get two nixed creature desings that are neat, and then we get two audio commentaries, one of the director solo and the other of the director with his assistant.  I didn't listen to either due to me being bored and unsatisfied with the film.  If I had hated this film more, then it would've been neat to listen to the commentary kind of like the commentaries to Pearl Harbor and Armageddon.  Both of those movies are absolutely the worst of big Hollywood but the commentaries somehow make them both worth owning for their hilarity(sometimes from the director's sincerity and others because actors like Ben Affleck make fun of the film the whole running time).So, there you have it.  The gimmick of an R rated puppet film might get people to view this, but it's nowhere near as good as something like Meet the Feebles or Team America.  So, I say if you dig this or like the idea it's a better idea to rent the other two films mentioned and really see where and by how much these filmmakers missed the mark.  I mean, i fell asleep in about 45 minutes of a one hour and ten minute film!!!!  That's really boring!!!!!

The clothes & hairdos are excellent & kind of show how the looks were similar almost at the time the movie was released (new wave, 50's-'60's clean looks, no more tackiness laid-back '70's styles).Similar to both stage & screen of first ""Grease,"" we have twentysomethings, some pushing 30 at the time, playing high school minors & they appear a little too mature & adult looking.

""Score Tonight"" would probably be my favorite musical # & what I reccommend as a sneak peek for those who have never seen this movie.

There was even the occasional person that would try to smoke in the bathrooms.

87833,0790728354,A2C27IQUH9N1Z,10,14,2003-08-08,Yikes!  Ouch!,"What a mess!  Tolkien wrote 4 books -- The Hobbit and its sequel, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, made up of The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King -- which together tell the story of the resurfacing and the destruction of the One Ring of Power wielded by Middle Earth's evil nemesis, Sauron.  The animated trilogy consists of The Hobbit and two films that should divide the trilogy in half, Lord of the Rings and The Return of the King, though so much material and so many characters are written out that they bear scant resemblance to the source material.  To further complicate matters, The Hobbit and The Return of the King are produced and directed by Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass, the team that brought to television almost every holiday classic that concerns Santa Claus, Frosty, Rudolph or the Easter Bunny, while the second film, The Lord of the Rings, was directed by Raph Bakshi.  Confused yet?  It's important to remember these facts because, other than catering to your need to be comprehensive, you will most likely enjoy Bakshi's effort but should run from the other two as if hellhounds were on your tail.There is so much missing here (including dropping major characters that were in the second instament!) that you will never comprehend the story as written by Tolkien, and even more importantly, the ubiquitous songs are SO plentiful, SO saccharin and SO dated that you may damage your fingers trying to fast forward through them all. DVD extras are slim -- textual screens about Tolkien, Middle Earth and the cast &amp; crew that were on the previous disks.Voice talent is good:  John Huston narrates and plays Gandalf, Orson Bean repeats as Bilbo and Frodo, and Roddy McDowall comes on board as Sam.  Also, the animation of scenery and sets is very good, though weaker with the characters.  Great liberties are taken with Tolkien's material.  Great honking abysmal liberties.The word 'travesty' may be a bit strong, but not by much.  I am generally a forgiving Tolkien fan, and indeed I enjoyed the animated Lord of the Rings directed by Bakshi just fine, but this is drek by a team that treated Tolkien as if he were just Jack Frost with hobbits.  For example, when he runs to Gandalf to let him know that Denethor is attempting suicide, Pippin yells, &quot;He's gone loony I tell ya!&quot;  I don't think you have to be a Tolkien geek to think that's just wrongThis film may appeal to the very young or the very deaf, but for anyone who has read the books, do yourself a favor and steer clear of this song-filled pillage of the 20th century's greatest work of literature.",2.0,0.7142857142857143,2,2,0.0,neutral,0.9927,very positive,2003,8,8

Happy Feet, ultimately an updated tale of the ugly duckling, tackles the sensitive issues of stigma and exclusion in a unique way.In this movie penguins sing. They have a soul voice and this gives them cultural identity. But when the lead character, Mumbles, is born with the gift of dance, he finds himself automatically ostracized from his emperor penguin community. What follows is a journey to right wrong and a challenge to discrimination.One of the flaws of Happy Feet is that you are never too sure who the intended target audience is: adults or children. Whereas traditional CGI movies (think any Pixar movie or Shrek et al) beguile the kids and tickle begrudging parents, Happy Feet wades in far too long and not too deep. My children (a five year old and a eight year old) began to lose interest once the novelty of singing and dancing penguins wore off. When I watched this in the cinema most children were meandering through the aisles. The truly painful rendition of Queen's classic 'Find Me Somebody to Love' didn't help matters.For me this movie is a little like crossing Moulin Rougue with the penguin biscuit commercial and unfortunately, despite the positve sentiment and clear message that to be different isn't necessarily a bad thing, left me cold and my children very bored.",2.0,0.5925925925925926,1,2,0.0,neutral,0.9529,very positive,2007,3,12
836391,B0002IQMAM,A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,5,14,2004-09-08,Four Reasons the Punisher Movie Sucks,"There are many reasons this movie doesn't work, but let's talk about the four biggest:(1) The filmmakers seem very concerned that viewers sympathize with Frank Castle after his family's murder. Again and again, we see him moping in his derelict apartment, drinking himself into a stupor. They want us to understand he's a VICTIM. They don't realize much of the appeal of the Punisher is that he's not a victim. We love Frank Castle because he's a hate-filled killer. He's the ""victim"" who gets even. Frank Castle doesn't mope, he kicks butt and doesn't even bother to take names. Thomas Jane's Punisher seems more sullen than dangerous.(2) They're just entirely too coy about ever showing Frank in costume. In the movie Frank's soon-to-be-deceased son gives him the skull shirt as a present. And Frank does wear it a few times. But we never see him in full regalia, the black costume, white boots and gloves, the skull emblem in glorious white spread across his chest, cartridge bandolier forming its teeth. WHY? The Punisher's stark costume would look great in live action. When you get right down to it, the Punisher's outfit is a Nazi SS uniform turned into a superhero suit. They just took that little skull off the hat, blew it up to huge proportions and put it on his chest as a superhero emblem. In one of my favorite Punisher stories, an old woman, a Nazi death camp survivor, sees the Punisher crossing a rooftop and freaks because she's thinks he's an SS officer.(3) Perhaps the reason they won't put Frank in costume is (as the makers of the Dolph Lundgren version explained) they ""didn't want him to look too much like a comic book character."" This leads into the next problem with the movie: the filmmakers have divorced the Punisher from the Marvel Universe and its other heroes. One of the ""DVD extras"" is a featurette interviewing many folks responsible for writing, drawing and managing the Punisher's ""life"" over the years, in which much is made of his being the most ""grounded,"" the most ""real world"" of Marvel's heroes. There's no indication anywhere in this film it's happening in the same reality that includes, for instance, Spider-Man. This was a serious error.Punisher writer Chuck Dixon once commented on a phenomenon he at first found difficult to understand: even when sales on the Punisher's own books were in the toilet, every time he appeared on the cover of another character's book - EVERY time - sales went through the roof. Dixon eventually realized the problem was that the Punisher had become the villain in his own book. Most Punisher tales saw Frank fighting to the death against some heavily armed amoral gun nut. Thing is, that's a fair description of the Punisher himself. It's just really hard to get emotionally involved in who's going to win a fight like that. But when the Punisher went up against another hero....ah, then you had some really interesting stuff happening: good versus evil, the question of who was right or wrong, the true-blue squeaky-clean hero or the ""hero"" who kills, and the danger the Punisher represented to the good guy himself. In the back of our minds was the tantalizing possibility that maybe one day Frank might just haul off and finally blow Daredevil right out of his socks. Okay, that'll never happen....but wouldn't it be cool if it did?(4) Comics tend to operate in perpetual present. 60-plus years ago Batman was Bruce Wayne who, as a child, saw his parents murdered before his eyes; 60-plus years from now he'll still be Bruce Wayne, still 30ish and physically perfect. They can do that because there's nothing in Batman's origin anchoring him to a specific time period. But much of what defines the Punisher as a character is that he was a Marine in Vietnam. When the character first appeared in 1974 that wasn't a problem. But as the years go by and the Vietnam War recedes further into the past, Frank Castle's age must necessarily progress also. Today, realistically, Castle must be WELL into his fifties. Now, it's not unbelievable an extremely physically fit man in his fifties, who started out with the right genetics and never let himself go, could do the things he does today. Especially if, like Frank Castle, you're running on high octane hate.So the filmmakers had a decision to make: retain the Vietnam angle and deal with Frank's age or change the origin. They chose the latter. Now Castle is an ex-FBI agent with counter-terrorist experience. Thing is, when you divorce Frank Castle from the hellhole of Vietnam, the agony and emotions that war still evokes in so many people, the character loses a lot of his power. Take Vietnam away from the Punisher and what's left? Apparently, a sullen pretty boy boozing it up in a crappy apartment.",2.0,0.3571428571428571,1,2,-0.6597,very negative,-0.9978,very negative,2004,9,8

The androids, however, are lying bastards and intend to keep everyone trapped on the planet forever.If keeping the crew trapped on the planet forever wasn't bad enough, they intend to use the Enterprise to roam the galaxy and enslave humankind to ""protect"" them from their own self-destructive behavior.Being logical beings, they see things in black and white, not shades of grey - so there is no reasoning with them. Being androids, however, means they cannot cope with illogical input.

Considered a seminal film in African-American cinema, Director Van Peebles feels it influenced the independent film movement as a whole. Its jazzy editing and strong hero set it miles apart from the standard fare - one can see how African-American audiences could see this film as a long-overdue cinematic thunderbolt.The plot is simple. Sweetback (Van Peebles himself) has grown up in a bordello to become one of its central attractions. One night, he agrees to accompany a pair of police officers downtown for questioning. A murder case lacks suspects, and the gesture appears to be compensation for the force's lenience toward the establishment.En route to the interrogation, however, the police intercept a youth on the street and brutally beat him. Using his handcuffs, Sweetback kills both officers. The rest is a protracted chase, with Sweetback using his fists (among other body parts) to make his way to the border. The police question his companions, hot on his trail with guns, bloodhounds and (at one point) a helicopter.Van Peebles has an eye for a striking shot, and there's some vivid scenes of police officers brutalizing Sweetback's friend Beetle that get their point across. While its historic contribution is clear, ""Sweetback"" has little to offer modern audiences beyond its kitsch value. Van Peebles is a strong presence as the laconic hero, but there's not much in the way of narrative or memorable characters to savor. There's plenty of sex and violence to be had (the 'X' rating is fully earned), but it's episodic - much of the film seems to be an enormous montage of repeated street scenes and dialogue clips, and the effect rapidly becomes tiresome.Thirty years after its explosive release, ""Sweetback"" will remain compelling for film historians and students. Its torch has been passed on to to other filmmakers, but the pioneering effort itself has not dated well.PS - The DVD release has an interview with the director. Initially, it shares some formal similarities with the feature, but later it settles into some interesting (and amusing) anecdotes.PPS - I just saw ""Badasssss!"" (Mario Van Peebles' docudrama on how ""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song"" was made) last night (10/25).

With Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp both top-billed, ""The Tourist"" also wants to be a romance, and even a comedy, too. Whatever the film may be, one thing is certain. ""The Tourist"" is a beautiful film to look at, but not much else beyond its surface.Johnny Depp is an American tourist Frank Tupelo, a math teacher on board the train heading to Venice. A beautiful, femme fatale-like woman Elise approaches to him and apparently Elise has been followed by men in suit. With two talented players and a beautiful Venice backdrop, ""The Tourist"" could have been a hugely entertaining suspense (or romantic / comedy suspense). Sadly, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, director of Oscar-winning ""The Lives of Others,"" seems not to know what he is making at all.Some may say people shouldn't take ""The Tourist"" too seriously. We know we shouldn't. The film was inexplicably nominated for three Golden Globes including Best Picture: Musical or Comedy category.

606326,B00005JLTK,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,3,9,2003-04-08,&quot;The Ring&quot; Didn't Quite Ring With Me,"If you ever hear young filmmakers talk about movies you'll almost always hear them say they want to make movies that have &quot;edge&quot;. John Waters, for years now has been saying he only likes to make movies with &quot;edge&quot;. They say they want to break away from formula Hollywood and make daring, bold, films. Movies that lack convention. I admit, I do enjoy seeing something different. I like movies that try to experiment with new techniques. But, I also noticed that many of these young new filmmaker are forgetting something. They are so worried about &quot;breaking the rules&quot;, they are so concerned with creating odd situation after odd situation, just so they can say they're films are different and they are a work of art, that they leave out one of the most fundamental rules of movies. The audience has to care about the characters. When I watch a movie I don't care if the lead character is a man or woman, whether or not they share my same ideas of politics, religion, or whatever. All I ask is that I at least find the character to be interesting enough, where I'm willing to give my emotions to the character. That's what makes a great movie. When the movies is over, we feel we ourslves have went through the same journey as the characters in the film. Once in a while a movie will remember this rule. David Lynch's &quot;Mulholland Dr.&quot; was one of those movies. It was one of the most mind-blowing complex movies I've seen in a while. But, Gore Verbinski's &quot;The Ring&quot; is a movie that just didn't move me the way it could have or should have.I see a lot of people enjoy this movie. They find the movie to be scary, and how can I tell someone who thinks something is scary it isn't? That's like telling someone don't laugh at that joke, I didn't find it funny. But, &quot;The Ring&quot; just gets a little too odd for it's own good. Now, don't get me wrong, the movie starts off well. And I do admire Naomi Watts as an actress. I think she is very talented. I even wanted to see this movie when it was released. So, I was going into the movie with high expectations. I wanted to like. But &quot;The Ring&quot; lost my attention in the middle and through the end. The movie just becomes and series of bizarre events where, for me, 1+1 doesn't equal 2. Think of Kafka but without the brains. Is it surreal? Yes. Does it make sense? Not really. Could the movie work? Yes.I haven't seen the original foreign version of this movie. Now, it may be better or it may be worst. But if it's as werid as this movie, I don't want to see it.&quot;The Ring&quot; tells the story of a woman (Naomi Watts) who learns about a video tape that has a collection is meaningless things on it, but, after I think it was 7 days, whoever watches the tape dies. Of course the movie goes into other things, and there is more added to the story, but, I'll let you rent the movie to find out what. I've given you a vague summary of the movie. Believe it or not, but in the beginning of the movie the story works. I didn't find the movie to be scary, but, I did find it to be interesting, and that's all I really ask of any movie. Just be able to hold my interest. And &quot;The Ring&quot; does reach it goal. It's actually enjoyable to watch at first, and than, it gets werid. Now, I know what all of you are thinking. I just said I liked &quot;Mulholland Dr.&quot; and that was a werid movie, so what's my problem here? How ever werid &quot;Mulholland Dr.&quot; may have got, it always held my interest. I wanted to see how the movie would end because I cared enough about the character to know. I didn't really care enough about the characters in &quot;The Ring&quot; to care how it ended. And that breaks the movie. If they just would of added a bit of logic to the movie. If they would of made the movie more believeable I could of enjoyed it more. Isn't that what makes a movie scary? If what is happening in the movie seems real enough that it could happen in real life? Those are the kinds of movies that scary me. Not this kind of movie.Are there things to be enjoyed while watching this movie. Well, if your a young filmmaker and you say you like to see movies with an &quot;edge&quot;, here you go! If you like Naomi Watts, and want to her all her movies again, here you go. Watts does in all fairness do a good job. She does give the character a certain level of heart need to carry our interest, but, it seems like no one else is helping her out. One person can't carry a movie by themself. Especially this type of movie.Bottom-line: Has some good points to it, but, over-all I wasn't scared by the movie. It gets too odd, and the audience can't really connect with anyone or anything. Goes a bit over the top and becomes silly at moments. Watts does though give a nice performance.",2.0,0.3333333333333333,3,3,0.0,neutral,0.9977,very positive,2003,4,8

The director should get five stars, but the film gets two stars because the plot is stale and the story seems to focus on image building of our Federal Agencies.This strikes me as a modern day knock-off of the TV series about the FBI, which ran in the 1950's, starring Ephram Zimbalist Jr.  It was extremely popular back then, assuring the public they should fear no evil just so long as the FBI was in charge.  It stayed that way until one day (long into the series) the public learned that each and every episode was personally approved by the Director of the FBI --- the man himself --- J. Edgar Hoover.  If I recall correctly, it was said that Hoover actually hand picked Zimbalist Jr., as the starring lead.

Does one not constantly use comparison as a basis for all judgements in life?  If you deny it, you are deceiving yourself.That said, the music and lighting and colors (cinematography shall we say, minus some instances of jiggly camera movement and disturbing slight zooms in and out) are almost always wonderful throughout this film.  Music + Cinematography = 4.8 Stars.  Beyond that, I was alternately cringing and smiling and the sum which was null.  The Rest = -0.8 Stars.  Thus Average = 2 Stars.It is not necessary to make a movie of a book just because you can.  There are many books, and this is one of them, that require more time to have justice done to their tales.  It's impossible (at least for me) to watch this movie without becoming frustrated, and that's not entertainment.  The dialog is mostly useless, in some parts you may find yourself wondering if the actors are actually being paid for their performances (it can't all be the fault of the screenplay can it?).  I found almost nothing enlightening in this version except for the aforementioned music and cinematography.  I agree with the negative criticism in other reviews of this version of P&P; but will not take the space to repeat it here.I hardly ever write reviews, but I felt irrepressably compelled speak out and warn would-be buyers of this film (probably because I bought it because of the high average rating) - rent it first!!If you've never read Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice or seen any other film versions, I encourage you to at least read the book first, and if you must watch this film version first, then afterwards see the 1995 version.

24114,0780020200,A1URWB7HMON61C,2,6,2013-04-07,Don't say I didn't warn you,"If ever there was an argument for going with your first reaction, this is it. Around the half way mark of this slight, dull, overpraised film, I resolved to persist in case something of value declared itself. Instead, the few modest virtues of the first half were obliterated by what appeared to be a slow motion parody of mid-century art films, in which vacillating and tormented Emmanuelle Riva (this is one of those films in which the protagonists aren't named) walks the nocturnal streets of Hiroshima and shares her every thought with us in an unvarying hushed monotone, while her new lover Eiji Okada follows a few paces behind with a fixed expression of anguished longing.I watched this early French New Wave film because critic David Thomson, who doesn't like much, couldn't speak highly enough of it. In hindsight, it's pretty clear that his inflated opinion of HMA came about because he was eighteen and impressionable when he watched it, the two leads are good looking and at first glance worldly, and they spend a great deal of time in bed, in a way that would have seemed pretty bold back in the day. That quite convincing scenario of genuine passion and eroticism in a one night stand unfortunately follows and is intercut with actual and re-enacted footage of Hiroshima victims in a way that is so pointlessly arty as to be obscene. Apparently Resnais was commissioned to make a film about the atomic bomb being a bad thing, but somehow managed to spend the money on this story which is completely unrelated, except that it makes the offensive implication that Riva's guilt about not being able to hold onto the memory of her German lover at the end of the war in occupied France is a tragedy comparable with the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives.I did what I could to prepare myself for this film, little realising that no preparation that didn't include the words DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU would be sufficient. I read (years after acquiring it) a chapter from compiled essays from Cahiers du Cinema which wasn't hugely informative about the film, but did discuss mise en scene, apparently a subject of spirited debate between Continental and English speaking critics in the early '60s, when people didn't have decades of lightweight pop culture to analyse and generally spend too much time talking about (if pressed, I'd say mise en scene is the look and the style of the film, as opposed to the story and the dialogue). Another book about '60s cinema made much of HMA's cutting between past and present, which was apparently innovative at the time and went on to influence Nicholas Roeg (famously the lovemaking scene in Don't Look Now) and others. That seemed good to me - I love cinematic genealogy, and it looked like there was an antecedent to Soderbergh's tricksy use of flashbacks - but what we see in the film seemed pretty routine, and was in any case robbed of ambiguity by Ms Riva explaining every little thing in voiceover. Maybe it's like author Geoff Dyer's observation about coming late to jazz pianist and acclaimed innovator Bud Powell, and finding he sounded familiar because he'd been so imitated.If this had been reduced to about thirty five minutes, with the lovers meeting, realising how deeply they felt for each other, but having to return to their spouses - a sort of consummated Franco-Japanese Brief Encounter  - it would have been a good film. I could have dug the dated score, which goes for a Herbie Hancock-Eric Dolphy vibe, and the look, and Riva's terrific Monica Vitti-style bangs. Instead, the longer it went, the madder I got, clutching at straws like when Riva portentously says &#34;They say there's a storm coming before nightfall&#34; (which was much funnier when Jean-Hughes Anglade intones it mid-copulation at the start of Betty Blue), or the couple stop for some more silent staring at a cavernous bar named, for no earthly reason, Casablanca. At one stage Okada waits until Riva draws breath between tragic reminiscences and slaps her soundly, which stops her only for a few moments, which I think brings things into focus: this film is The Terminator of arty dullness.",2.0,0.3333333333333333,1,1,-0.0565,neutral,-0.6801,very negative,2013,4,7

And he also didn't have two daughters (he had one son, Mordred) as in this movie.Well, most of the movie is spent with the people from that era usually the nobility and knights and Arthur's one daughter who is the kid's age, oggling at his backpack (which he lukily brought with him) of futuristic ""wonders"" and they have a jolly good time.  But he wants to get back home.  Where's Merlin, oh, he's a willy old face in a well.  Yep.  So he gets about a days worth of knight training from a non-realistic generous knight and suddenly he's a master fighter and jouster as seen later in the film.Anyways, the movie ends with him getting back and his new love (Arthur's daughter) and Arthur being in the real world with him (yeah, like Arthur would leave his kingdom for some kid) and he's sent back before the infamous strike out.  Blah blah blah.All in all, kids may be impressed and like this movie.  I didn't find it too entertaining.

Of course it may ultimately be a story worth filming, if only for us to be yet again astonished at what else the human psyche is capable of inflicting on those who least deserve it.  And naturally, such a bizarre formula will find it's audience, as schlock movies do as well.But, for me, there are just too many loose ends; improbable and melo-dramatic solutions to the story to deserve the accolades that are being showered upon it for some or other inexplicable reason.  The film lacks finesse and understanding and approaches its subject matter pandering to an unintelligent audience, which is hooked on matter that may be likened to fast food.  Of course there's nothing wrong with this if it happens to be your taste.

15293,076781956X,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,2,3,2000-07-23,drab drama,"Probably the most unique aspect of this film in this age of videotape and DVDs is its choice of title. No one uses 8MM anymore, do they? Actually, 8MM is an essentially routine thriller given a patina of originality by  being set in the sleazy world of hardcore, violent pornography.  Unfortunately, like most mainstream commercial productions, this film never  really explores this world in any depth, but uses it as window dressing for  a tired, by-the-numbers private eye meller.The film stars Nicholas Cage  as a Pennsylvania-based private investigator called in by a wealthy widow  to determine whether a &quot;snuff&quot; film she's found among her late  husband's personal possessions is the genuine article. Cage heads off to  Hollywood, the mecca of all things pornographic, hooks up with Joaquin  Phoenix as a Capote-reading porn shop clerk and all around nice guy, and  stumbles into a den of iniquity that leads him to the mystery's eventual  unraveling.Unlike a courageous film like 1984's &quot;Tightrope&quot;,  in which Clint Eastwood's cop character begins more and more to identify  with the sleazy world he's investigating and, in the process, unlocks dark,  hidden recesses buried deep within his own psyche, 8MM's main character  never seems even momentarily ensnared by the dark visions seeping into his  brain. Indeed, Cage's investigator remains morally superior throughout.  This allows for the film to settle for a routine, bloodsoaked revenge  melodrama resolution and to avoid having to develop and cope with a complex  central character. Even though director Joel Schumacher manages to create  an initial atmosphere of dark gloominess, it's essentially wasted in a  welter of action movie cliches and unconvincing heroics.Too bad that a  film that promises to open up a world on film unfamiliar to mainstream  audiences manages to make even pornography and all the denizens that toil  in it seem hopelessly humdrum.",2.0,0.6666666666666666,14,1,0.0,neutral,-0.631,very negative,2000,7,23

In the book the oldest girl was supposed to be 12 when they came to the attic, in the movie she looks 15 or 16. In the book the grandmother didn't cut the oldest girls hair, she tried but Chris stopped her. And what happened to the incest? It carried such huge messages and themes in the book and in the movie there is none of it. I could go on for pages about the inconsistensies, even the ending is hugely different. I swear sometimes when they actually said something from the book I would think &quot;Hey! That's kinda like Flowers In The-...oh yeah...&quot;. But to defend the makers of this movie a bit, this was before the entertainment industry relized how much it annoys people when they don't follow much loved books. I mean look at the 2 latest movies based on books, Lord Of The Rings and Harry Potter. They are two great books with movies that are good as well and stay true to them. I really wish they would remake the movie and have a movie for each book in the series. I think Flowers In The Attic was around 400 pages. When a 400 page book is squashed into an 85 minute movie it isn't pretty...But for a moment here lets forget about the book, now lets look at the problems with the stand alone movie. The acting was quite weak at times. Cory's voice was annoying but I actually respected that because it seemed more realistic. Another thing I like about the movie was how it showed that man digging the four graves, that was a very eerie well done scene. A shame it was only 4 seconds and the rest of the movie never had that eerie mood. A movie like this really should have that eerie mood. It all happened too fast. And you never got to know the characters well enough to feel bad for them. You never got to know the mother well enough to be shocked when the truth came out. Nothing was understood, there seemed to be a shortage of lines. And half the lines were chocked full of emotion that came to soon and too rushed. Instead of getting the feeling they were in the attic for years, you feel they were in the attic for 85 minutes, the time of the movie. It doesn't glide you from scene to scene, it puts more circles under the childrens eyes and tell you it's been a few months. And by skipping those few months we lose a lot of important dialoge and emotions that must have passed between the children. All in all you should really only watch this out of curiosity, not for entertainment, and not for a substitute of the book.",2.0,0.8837209302325582,1,1,0.0,neutral,-0.551,negative,2002,1,3

Cartoon like acting by all. Really Samuel L. Jackson did this movie of his own free will?  He must of owed someone a favor. If you want to see Stana Katic in a movie as a decent and respectable character, this would be it.  Unfortunately you have to sit through the movie to see that character.For me,the only pleasant thing in this movie that I could appreciate was that Stana didn't use any F bombs (apparently her favorite word from her interviews), snort drugs, smoke, drink, murder anybody, unbutton her blouse, take her clothes off or let someone take them off of her, or perform any sexually explicate acts real or simulated on any of the men or women in the cast.  This is the only movie she has been in that I have been able to watch clear to the end and it was a stinker.  Usually I never get past the trailer or Youtube clips to watch any of her vehicles.  I don't want to feel like I need to shower after watching a movie because of the enormous amount of filth spewed out of the actor's dialogue or the actions of the roles portrayed.Stana's performance as a funny cop character in this effort reminded me of the humor Beckett shows in Castle.  Her enormous talent and beauty are displayed in this small part but still this movie choice has to go in the B movie straight to DVD list just as all of her others.  Castle and her name will make all of these turkeys some money that they would never have made in theaters or on DVD without Castle's popularity.Stana's use of vulgar language, her actions, and entertainment choices are offensive and very disappointing to me.  She could be my daughter, my daughter is about her age and I just wonder what must her parents think and I can't help but wonder about all those young fans who idolize her and want to be like her because of Beckett when they discover what the real person is like.  How must they and her parents feel in their hearts when they hear Stana talk like she does or see what she is willing to do in a movie selling herself for a producer or director's praise and accolades or some useless award that in the end counts for nothing.I'll pray for a change of her heart, someone must, she is too blessed with talent and beauty from GOD to flip Him off with her life choices, actions, and vocabulary like she does.",2.0,0.0,1,2,-0.4019,negative,0.994,very positive,2013,8,18

Happy Feet, ultimately an updated tale of the ugly duckling, tackles the sensitive issues of stigma and exclusion in a unique way.In this movie penguins sing. They have a soul voice and this gives them cultural identity. But when the lead character, Mumbles, is born with the gift of dance, he finds himself automatically ostracized from his emperor penguin community. What follows is a journey to right wrong and a challenge to discrimination.One of the flaws of Happy Feet is that you are never too sure who the intended target audience is: adults or children. Whereas traditional CGI movies (think any Pixar movie or Shrek et al) beguile the kids and tickle begrudging parents, Happy Feet wades in far too long and not too deep. My children (a five year old and a eight year old) began to lose interest once the novelty of singing and dancing penguins wore off. When I watched this in the cinema most children were meandering through the aisles. The truly painful rendition of Queen's classic 'Find Me Somebody to Love' didn't help matters.For me this movie is a little like crossing Moulin Rougue with the penguin biscuit commercial and unfortunately, despite the positve sentiment and clear message that to be different isn't necessarily a bad thing, left me cold and my children very bored.",2.0,0.5925925925925926,1,2,0.0,neutral,0.9529,very positive,2007,3,12

When I saw it I was very small.  Maleficent, the evil witch that put a curse on Aurora, frightened me, as she did when she became the gigantic fire-breathing dragon.  I had a few nightmares about this film.I would caution parents with very small children to watch the tape first without the child present to see if these images are appropriate for their child.  At times, Disney was a bit too over-the-top in the earlier classic cartoons when it came to violence and death and I can recall a few other films he made where the images were too much for me to understand and frightened me instead.  I remembering being very upset when Bambi's mother was shot dead, crying through a good portion of the rest of the film. When I saw Snow White's stepmother turn into the wicked old hag I could no longer look at the screen and wanted to leave the theater.Disney's company was even responsible for a horrible cartoon called ""Hitler's Children"" that was made during WWII, I believe as propaganda.

While there, Jones and fellow lady friend Carol Fisher (Laraine Day) get caught up in an espionage plot involving the start of the war.I'll admit that the visuals are very well done for 1940, and a few sequences even provoke genuine suspense, but I just could not get into the plot whatsoever, as it seemed to drag on and on with little action or character development to move things forward.Thus, if you are a hard-core Hitch fan, watch this one.

Also, Donald Pleasance returns as a scarred but still living Dr. Loomis.  However, that being said, this movie really fails as a competent sequel to Halloween 2.First, the movie fails to capture the Halloween theme as John Carpenter did in Halloween 1 & 2.  There is just something that Halloween 1 & 2 had that all of the sequels do not and it's not so much the acting as it is mood and/or motif.  I think John Carpenter had a lot to do with the genuine Halloween theme in the first two movies and he was not a major contributor to Halloween 4.The plot is centered around a young child named Jamie Lloyd, evidently the daughter of Laurie Strode, (Jamie Lee Curtis-Halloween) and she is tormented by a nightmare of Michael Myers coming after her.  However, these dreams prove to be prophetic in that Michael Myers is enraged when he discovers that he still has a living relative.  Myers discovers this while lying down in a comatose state in an abulance being transported to Smith's Grove.  In his anger, Myers sticks his thumb into the skull of one some doctor/paramedic...great scene.  Evidently, Myers has also put on quite a bit of muscle while he was in that coma for 10 years because this Myers is considerably larger than the original.Anyway, he returns to Haddonfield and racks up a pretty good amount of victims in his path including shoving a shotgun into the stomach of some teenaged girl.  The plot is very predictable as Myers kills his way to try and get a hold of his niece.  At any rate, the movie really doesn't deliver the goods like the original Halloween and Halloween II, but nevertheless, there are quite a few good kills in this movie and that's why I give 2.99 stars for a pretty good slasher flick, but I cannot justify giving this movie three stars as there is definitely nothing special about it. Halloween IV is pretty good as far as the slasher type flick is concerned, but it really fails to deliver the horror to the audience like Halloween and Halloween II.So, if you are in the mood for a slasher film, you might want to pick this up, but if you are in the mood for a really good Halloween movie, buy Halloween 1 and 2.",2.0,0.3333333333333333,5,2,-0.7711,very negative,0.4471,positive,2005,2,27

291480,6302032237,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,3,11,2010-07-03,Noir Western,"Naked Spur is one of those B westerns produced in the 50s when westerns were at their peak. Although this period did produce some classic films, in general they were disappointing, and specifically, to this film, very disappointing.The film is basically a film about greed. To me it is reminiscent of 1948s ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"". In that film, 3 prospectors (Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston, and Tim Holt) turn against each other on a long journey to town after they discovered gold. In this film, 3 cowboys turn against each other on a long journey to town in order to collect a $5000 reward. The difference is that ""Naked Spur"" has Robert Ryan as the wanted man who spurs the conflict, while in ""Treasure"" there is no visible cause, apart from the greed.The film stars Jimmy Stewart (1908-97). Stewart is a film icon. He was nominated for an Oscar 5 times, winning once (""The Philadelphia Story"" in 1940). He had 2 BAFTA nominations (""Anatomy of a Murder"", ""The Glenn Miller Story"") and 3 Golden Globe nominations including one win (""Hawkins"" in 1971). Twice he won the New York film critics award (""Anatomy of a Murder"" and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"") and he also gave us such memorable performances in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"". Stewart worked extensively with Alfred Hitchcock and together they made ""Rope"" (1948), ""Rear Window"" (1954), ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" (1956), and ""Vertigo"" (1958).The film is directed by Anthony Mann (1906-67). Mann originally specialized in film noir in the 40s (e.g., ""T-Men"", ""Raw Deal"") but starting in 1950 with ""The Furies"" he began to make westerns and put out a dozen, although he still on occasion, made other types of films (e.g., ""Strategic Air Command"", ""God's Little Acre"", ""El Cid""). Mann received 3 DGA nominations (""El Cid"", ""Men at War"", ""The Glenn Miller Story"").Naked Spur is the third of eight collaborations between Stewart and Mann, five of which were westerns. Their first film together,""Winchester 73"", is the best of their western films, and it was this film that re-established Stewart as a major star who could command cast and director approval as well as receive a percentage of the profits.Mann brought his film noir sensitivities to the western genre, and this blend produced a western that was distinct from the Ford (""Fort Apache"", ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"") or the Hawks (""Red River"", ""Rio Bravo"") films as well as the films of Budd Boetticher (""Commanche Station"", ""The Tall T""). Though Ford and Hawks tended to use John Wayne, Mann used Stewart and Boetticher used Randolph Scott. Rarely did one of the directors use one of the stars used by the other director (notable exception being Ford using Stewart in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"").Unfortunately,  the blend of film noir and westerns has rarely worked well. Raoul Walsh's ""Pursued"" (1947) and Nicholas Ray's ""Johnny Guiitar"" are exceptions to this rule. While noir westerns per se were not terribly successful, they did help turn the traditional western into a more balanced genre. One can only imagine that ""The Searchers"" (1956) would not have been possible without the influence of the noir westerns.Robert Ryan (1909-73) co-stars as the killer whom Stewart is trying to take back to Abilene for trial. Ryan made nearly 100 films over a 30+ year career. He was nominated for an Oscar (""Crossfire"", 1947) and a BAFTA (""Billy Budd"", 1962) and won an NBR Award (""The Iceman Cometh"", 1973). Ryan was a favorite of film noir directors, working with Nicholas Ray (""On Dangerous Ground"", 1951) and Robert Wise (""Set Up"", 1949). He often played military roles (""Dirty Dozen"", ""Longest Day"", ""Battle of the Bulge"") and westerns (""The Professionals"", ""Bad Day at Black Rock""), and I think his best role was in Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969). Ryan's performance in ""Naked Spur"" is one of his poorest performances of his long career. His villain is far too convivial and his attempts to create conflict are so self-evident it's hard to believe that this script was filmed.Beautiful Janet Leigh (1927) plays a simple girl who latches on to Ryan as a substitute father figure. We all know Leigh from her role in ""Psycho"" (1960), but she made more than 50 films and gave us memorable roles in ""Touch of Evil"" (1958) and ""Manchurian Candidate"" (1962) among others. She made 5 films with her husband Tony Curtis, and appeared twice with her daughter Jamie Lee Curtis. Leigh's performance in this film is comical. She seems to fall in and out of love in every other scene.Millard Mitchell (1903-53) plays an old prospector who teams up with Stewart to bring Ryan back and split the reward. Mitchell appeared in more than 30 films and won the Golden Globe for ""My Six Convicts"" (1952). He gave us memorable performances as Gregory Peck's commanding officer in ""Twelve O'Clock High"" (1949) and as the movie mogul in ""Singing in the Rain"" (1952). He gives the only good performance in this film.Ralph Meeker (1920-88) plays a dishonorably discharged cavalry man who joins up with Stewart. Meeker appeared in more than 50 films and as many TV programs, but never attained more than B star status. His performance here is similar to his performance in other films - nothing really distinguished but certainly adequate.One of the few good parts of the film is the scenery. Mann is famous for his use of landscape, and this is another one of his prime examples. The NY Times praised the ""settings that are superb and seemingly created for Technicolor.""The film was a box office success, as were most 50s westerns, and most films with Jimmy Stewart. It received a nomination for Best Screenplay, but didn't win.Fans of the western can find hundreds of better films. Fans of Jimmy Stewart can find dozens of better films, even from the non-westerns he did with Mann. Fans of the other stars will also find that their favorite actors can be seen in much better films. Even Anthony Mann fans can find better films elsewhere. There is simply nothing to recommend this film.",2.0,0.2727272727272727,2,1,0.0,neutral,0.9986,very positive,2010,7,3

I think it could be both and it depends on how you feel toward the Christianity, the possibility of undergoing a religious conversion, and the readiness to sacrifice the most precious that you have to prove your faith and love for God.

While there, Jones and fellow lady friend Carol Fisher (Laraine Day) get caught up in an espionage plot involving the start of the war.I'll admit that the visuals are very well done for 1940, and a few sequences even provoke genuine suspense, but I just could not get into the plot whatsoever, as it seemed to drag on and on with little action or character development to move things forward.Thus, if you are a hard-core Hitch fan, watch this one.

A group of Mayans are chasing after a Tapir (a pig like animal) and after killing the animal they come across a group of refugees. Jaguar Paw our main character (Rudy Youngblood), decides to ask them where they are going but, his Grandfather Flint Sky (Morris BirdYellowhead) stops him from proceeding with any further questions. When returning back to their village they are enjoying themselves when suddenly they are attacked by a Maya War Party and majority of the women and men are taken back to the Maya City. While they are being taken as prisoners, our hero manages to save his pregnant wife and small child by putting them in a pit.  While traveling to the Mayan Metropolis, they encounter a little girl who spoke about a prophecy (who looks like a younger version of Satan, from Passion of the Christ.) She tells them of a great darkness that will befall the Mayan civilization resulting from a solar eclipse and of a man who will run with the jaguars--in fact, he was being chased by the jaguar. The Mayan war party ignores the little girl's prophecy. Will the prophecy come to past? Will Jaguar Paw escape from his captives and the jaguar? You have to see this movie to fine out!!Mel Gibson the actor (Funny, cool, and a nice guy) but Mel (the director) he is serious, likes history, but he also likes a lot of gore and brutality to help express his story telling.Mel Gibson's direction of Acopatypto is somewhat different then his previous two films; Brave Heart, and  The Passion of the Christ.  In the first he had to show that fighting in battle would present gore and brutality and in the Passion he had to show the realism of Jesus Christ's torturing and most importantly a sadistic nature by the Romans who were torturing him.Now, Mr. Gibson is presenting a movie that we think is about the Mayan civilization, and first off we think that the movie should be about the understanding of the culture, the avant-garde cities, the towering pyramids, their mathematics, and even their astronomy. There are a lot of inaccuracies with this movie as some critics have stated; the architecture, the murals used in the movie (Mel put in extra footage in the paintings), and most importantly their costumes and traditions ( when the Mayans were throwing the bodies off the Pyramids and the female dancers (in which the females didn't participate at in the Mayan rituals) were catching the bodies in big fishing nets.Instead he decides to focus on a similar theme of brutality and gore from his previous two films. You might ask the question, why not?He has a political theme. He compares Mayan human sacrifice with ""sending guys off to Iraq for no reason."" Folks, after I viewed this film I would have to agree and disagree with Mr. Gibson point of view. First off, let me explain what he is trying to say. He understands (through his research, right!) that the Mayans were pious about offering themselves to their Gods and our Americans soldiers have that same honor and respect for God and our country. That all sounds great but he does not present the Mayans who are being offered to be of a pious nature but that of a slave mentality with a Hostel (the horror film) intent. What people should perceive from his point of view is that senseless killing is going on not only in Iraq but the rest of the world, like Africa. But for the average movie goers they will never understand that there is even a political subtext being considered for this film.Now folks, lets talk about the film itself and boy, there are some problems with this film. His direction has no originality, why? Because, he uses themes from his previous films that he has directed and acted in. One example that comes to mind is the fighting sequences used toward the end of our film. When one of the War party that being the Maya chief (Mauricio Amuy Tenorio) is confronting Jaguar Paw. This is the same exact scene from the movie The Patriot, where Col. William Tavington (Jason Isaacs) is facing off against Benjamin Martin (Mel) and the only difference is instead of a battle field, it is now the jungle. Or, when Jaguar Paw is going to be sacrificed and he has the image of his wife flash into his mind, which is the same thing in Brave Heart. When William Wallace at his execution he sees his dead bride's ghost Murron , (Catherine McCormack) walking through the crowds of people. But what really got my attention is that he had to take themes from Predator and some reminders of Home Alone.  There are several instances for example when Jaguar Paw falls from the water fall or, when Jaguar Paw falls into the mud while running from his pursuers.Or, when Jaguar Paw throws a disguised bee hive at his pursuers and when he takes poison from a frog to use it as a weapon. This has a very similar theme to what Kevin (Culkin) did in Home Alone 1 and 2.Please, if you are going to see this movie with the intent of understanding the Mayan Culture and their advancements. Please stay home because this movie shows brutality and Sadistic brutality with gore. This movie is an insult to the Mayan people because there are still six million descendants still living in Mexico and Central America, who he still has to answer too.",2.0,0.1428571428571428,1,3,-0.8402,very negative,-0.9883,very negative,2007,10,24

The only thing that is correct about this print is that it is in the original cinemascope super-widescreen aspect ratio of the original theatrical release.  But the print on this DVD is badly worn.  The vibrant colors of cinemascope have become faded out and oxidized.  But worse still, the coloration oscillates constantly throughout the movie, constantly going back and forth between faded but accurate colors, to a brownish oxidized coloration.  If A2ZCDS.com made any attempt at restoration, it was a failure.  This movie deserves the UCLA digital restoration treatment to bring it back to life.I find this movie totally enjoyable.  The actors are some of my favorites: the pretty and delightful Terry Moore, the ruggedly handsome and magnetic Gilbert Roland, and the terrific character actor J. Carrol Naish. Robert Wagner was not one of my favorites, but is quite good in his role here. Throw in the accomplished actors like Peter Graves and Richard Boone, and you have a lot of talent to watch.

Their parents will cringe as they are forced to sit through more second rate CG animation that borders on unbearable. Marvel accomplished what they set out to do in the end. They created something else for the younger fans to bug their parents to buy for them.

Most of this film, however, seems forced and unpolished.  She is so busy trying to wrap her humor around politically incorrect material, that she doesn't bother to cut the parts that aren't funny - which unfortunately is most of it.  The part where she is imitating gay men blocking out her jokes about straight people is funny.  Mommy in Israel, at the very end, is probably the best part.  Most of it, though, is just nasty comedy about her sexcapades with both genders, in gross detail.  Not only do you feel sorry for her putting on this unpolished and not ready performance, but her confessions about all that she has done makes you feel sad for her life as well.I don't mind politically incorrect humor.  I definetely don't mind humorist taking pot shots at the political scene.  But it must be funny first!  This wasn't funny at all.

Its heavy on despair, misery, hopelessness and death.The movie has some great acting from Meryl Streep but unfortunately the other cast are not really as functional as you would have expected. The movie does go to that next level in makeup effects such as aging, changing a persons face completely and the presentation of an aids victim.

Stephen Daldry is not a very good director and if you did not like Billy Elliot then you will probably not like this vehicle either.

'Escaflowne: The Movie' is essentially a re-telling or ""re-interpretation"" of the original TV series, but with literally everything from the original radically changed. This is not a good thing.Take the characters: it's bad enough that Van and Allen have been turned from fairly chivalrous heroes into ruthless men of action. But to make the awkward-but-endearing heroine Hitomi into a depressed borderline-suicide case is unforgivable. Why you'd want to butcher such a fantastic character, who became the pinup girl for geek guys everywhere, is beyond me. And the antagonists fare no better, with the well-developed Folken of the series reduced to a cardboard-cutout Bad Guy.Remember how the TV series contained elements from nearly every genre: mecha action, fantasy, drama, comedy, and romance? Well, very little has been retained here except the action. The epic feel of the series has been replaced by a more straightforward action-driven plot, and the mood is much darker and more intense than the original. The  animation quality certainly is an improvement on the original thanks to a movie-strength budget, but not even the best artwork will turn a poor anime into a good one.Really, you can hardly call this 'Escaflowne' at all.  None of the characters are how they used to be, the plot is a fairly derivative action-fest compared to the series, and the mood is more suited to a dark, violent thriller.

How in the world could this possibly even get down to $5?"" Then I watched it. ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" is one of my favorite movies, and I adored the chemistry between McConaughey and Kate Hudson. It was like those two were meant to be together in real life, much like my other favorite movie characters (ex. Nia Long and Larenz Tate, Gabrielle Union and Idris Elba, Bill Cosby and Phylicia Rashad). However, I did not see that same chemistry between Parker and McConaughey. I thought they gave it a great shot, but I didn't believe those two would ever date. Something about the two of them just seemed off to me.On top of that, through the whole movie, I just couldn't picture McConaughey living at home. He seemed more suited to play Bradley Cooper's role as the wanderer. Justin Bartha should've played the lead. He could've pulled this role off. Zooey Deschanel's role was annoying and didn't really add to the script. I lost interest in her being the cranky roommate who wanted to kill a mockingbird almost instantly and didn't even think Bartha's character would give her the time of day. I liked the relationship between McConaughey's character Tripp and Tyrel Jackson Williams' character Jeffrey though. I wish somebody would've showed a picture or a scene from his last girlfriend because since we really had so little backstory, their relationship seemed like a last minute decision.The only two people I really enjoyed in this film were Tripp's parents, Terry Bradshaw as Al and Kathy Bates as Sue. I thought their problem with not wanting to let their kid go and not knowing how to get to know each other again as a couple--not just as parents--was a valid and interesting story.

1061079,B000NVT0S4,A280GY5UVUS2QH,5,7,2008-04-11,Why Biopics are So  Bad,"Why Biopics are So Bad:Problem One: Biopics are notoriously reductive. Real people are complex but biopics are always trying to turn real people's real lives into storylines with plots, or worse: morality plays. Real life and real lives do not necessarily have plots from which we can parse meanings; people do not live so that their lives can be transformed into movies. Warhol may have thought fame was the ultimate drug, but most of his hangers-on made fun of the debacle that was stardom. The Warhol crew debunked Hollywood myths and icons and they mocked the Hollywood myth and icon making machine. They didn't really admire the famous anymore than they admired America, they wanted to expose the famous and the seedy underside of fame and in doing so expose America. Warhol and his factory workers turned fame and America into high camp. This was brilliant and this is what Edie was attracted to (I'm guessing). This biopic, however, makes it look as though Edie just didn't get it, and that she thought Andy was being sincere when he labeled her a ""superstar."" Ok, I never knew Edie but I doubt the filmakers did either; nevertheless, they have decided to take a reverent stance toward Edie and an irreverent one toward Andy. And present Edie as a victim and Andy as a victimizer. Why? Because you need a good conflict to make cinema seems to be the answer on these unimaginative filmmakers minds. This seems highly problematic for several reasons, but the primary reason why this way of thinking always equals bad art is because this kind of thinking requires that the adherents reject the complications of real life in favor of familiar fictive formulas; formulas that require that there always be two sides to every equation: good and bad guys, victims and exploiters, innocents and experienced artists/actors/social players. These filmakers simply cast aside reality and invent an ""Edie"" that fits the former and an ""Andy"" that fits the latter side of these simplistic binaries. This is insanely reductive. It also happens to be classic feminism, but with one glaring problem: Andy hardly fits the part of the classic ""exploitive male"" and Edie the part of the classic ""exploited female."" Its also ironic: this film takes two people who were famous for mocking American artistic and social and symbolic structures/paradigms (including its gender paradigms which were reified over and over again in Hollywood films) and turns them into formulaic players in the kind of movie that they would have loved to hate.Problem Two: It is VERY difficult to make a film about a real person, and especially a real person that living people still remember. The reason people become famous and achieve the iconographic status that they do has to do with indeterminable and unnamable factors. But the actors that play these enormous icons do not themselves possess those indeterminable and unnamable factors that made the original so unique and so striking. Just looking like someone doesn't qualify you to play them: look-a-like celebrities (even if the look-a-like is a celebrity in their own right) are always weak. Looking at someone doing a bad impersonation of Jack Nicholson just makes you feel sad for the world. We should be originals not bad copies. Biopic acting is always bad acting. Movie versions of real lives are always bad.No one will ever be able to play John F.Kennedy, or Elvis, or Mick, or Brian Jones, or John Lennon, or Bob Dylan, or Kurt Cobain.No one will be ever able to play Freida Kahlo, or Marilyn Monroe, or Edie Sedgwick, or Patti Smith.Unique people are unique. Actors can't play them. And impersonations always look like impersonations. Purposely bad impersonations are the only really good ones.Problem Three: The makers of biopics are bad historians. In most cases, history, to the crafter of a biopic, is the same as ambiance and is no more or less important than any other design element. In the cases when time period does matter, and historical context is respected as a significant factor in peoples lives, history is presented in caricature.  With the sixties in particular filmmakers have been especially inaccurate. They invariably get it wrong; either they over-sentimentalize or over-idealize the decade, or they judge its excesses. Factory Girl does the latter. It does not make the sixties look in any way attractive, rather the sixties through the eyes of this filmmaker just look filthy (as in grimy) and seedy and mean.Problem Four: Films with an agenda are always bad. This is a film with a feminist agenda. Feminism is not necessarily bad, but feminist films are always bad. Even if we take the film on its own feminist terms and consider the possibility that feminine muses often end up being victimized by those male artists that they inspire (Rodin's model and muse and apprentice Camille Claudel is another historical example)we still end up in a hopelessly reductive virtual land that has little to do with the actual world. The film begs us to see Edie as a helpless victim of her father's and Andy's and other prowling male's vile desires. But are we to assume her own desires/ambitions/manipulations are holy just because they are feminine?A Note on Ciao Manhattan: Ciao Manhattan is a fascinating and wonderfully trashy early 70's burn-out film. In it Edie plays an ""Edie""-like ""star"" whose coming down from a decade-long high surrounded by a number of B-movie characters.  It's fascinating because we think we are watching someone play themselves. But whether this is Edie being Edie or Edie playing an old version of herself or someone elses idea of her is impossible to tell. Biopics are never really about real life. They are products. They are about preconceived & pre-packaged ways of thinking about life, and second-hand and second-rate ways of thinking about life at that. Because its actually Edie on screen viewers want to believe this film is different than most biopics. Edie herself, however, seems much less interested in her reality or her myth than everyone else around her seems to be. Maybe at the factory she liked to be looked at, but in this film it seems Edie no longer feels like anyone that matters is looking anymore. In Ciao Manhattan she is always dazed & confused, she never really wakes up, its as if there is no longer anyone there to wake up for. Maybe for her life was a performance and in the end there was just no one left to perform for.The film is both a deconstruction of a star and a last act. So, gaudy & tasteless as it is (to turn someones pain & suffering into spectacle), there is something there (Edie herself) that transcends the usual biopic paradigms. And even though we feel guilty for looking, we can't seem to take our eyes off of her. Its as if there is something there that we want, that we need to know but we can never quite put our finger on it. That is the nature of stardom.Recommended for further viewing: Nicolas Roeg's Performance",2.0,0.7142857142857143,2,1,-0.5849,negative,-0.9823,very negative,2008,4,11

I'm not a fan of movies that start out by heading in one direction only to halt in the middle of something and then backtracking with a new account: 2 days earlier.  This is especially irksome when the direction Boll was initially heading was too brief to establish anything but a few scattered images and an explosion; he might just as well have started the movie two days earlier!  Not that it would have made any difference as the timeline in this piece was suspect throughout.  Images were oft repeated, news reports kept chattering in the background announcing events that hadn't happened yet, were happening, or had just happened.  At any given moment, it was never certain what was taking place, was it real, was it about to happen, had it happened already, or were these just the conflicting images and random thoughts of a lunatic, or a very savvy bank robber?  I don't mind a little ambiguity now and then but not throughout an entire movie.  It's as if a hyperactive kid filmed then edited this piece as a class project.  At the close of it I wasn't quite certain what the point was; it isn't cynical enough to be political, it doesn't have the style necessary to make it an art film, the action isn't organized enough to make it a thriller.  What then?  Even the title is misleading, for although the lead character does go on a rampage, he never displays the required rage to make it feel justified (if only in his own mind).  The few circumstances that were brought up as evidence only suggested that he was having a really bad day.  Were all his days like this?As a whole, I found this movie curiously flat, displaying little emotion in thought or deed.  The biggest problem with this premise is that it demonstrated little we don't already know, while giving us characters so unrealized that we can't care about them or what happens to them.

We have a story in which Brendan Fraser's scientist brother Max has disappeared and Trevor (Brendan Fraser)  is setting out to search for him.  But he gets saddled with having to care for Sean, Max's son played by Josh Hutcherson, who starts out as a bratty teenager and, of course, is initially p......d-off at the world.  (Actually, I was suspicious that Max simply couldn't stand Sean any longer and just took off).But, no. They follow Max's trail, aided by pretty guide, Hannah (Anita Briem) who causes Sean to drool a little, to the mouth of a volcano. They all begin to fall down a rabbit hole and finally land on a heap of sticks  and dry leaves -- no, I'm sorry, that's in Alice in Wonderland.  The volcano's hole turns into a water slide and they enter into a world that resembles a defective ride in a theme park.  They discover that Max had died there, of boredom no doubt, and encounter gigantic Venus flytraps (I  never saw any gigantic flies, though), dinosaurs stomping around and birds that glow in the dark.  They also get to ride in a mining car which turns into a roller-coaster that manages to jump across a ten foot gap and land on the tracks on the other side, the chances against that happening being about 30 billion to one.  At another point on their raft, a sharp-toothed fish is getting closer and closer to taking a bite out of Hannah's rump as Sean is watching and his lips seem to be saying ""Go for it, go for it!""Even though I was watching this movie in 2D, it was obvious that it was shot in 3D because actors are seen pointing out at the camera or shooting a yo-yo out of the frame at you or some other shenanigans, which simply stalls any continuity this film might have had.  By the time it's over Sean has transformed into a smiling puppy, licking his uncle's hand or whatever.The 1959 version of this story is a much superior film, having actors such as James Mason, Arlene Dahl and Pat Boone (Pat Boone??  Yes, it is Pat Boone), it's rather antique special effects notwithstanding.  Some shots were actually made in Carlsbad Caverns, I believe.  Now, you can't get more realistic than that.  The backgrounds in this new film look very much like painted scenery flats and the dinosaur chase scene with the characters running in the foreground on a treadmill is clearly a green screen process not particularly well executed.I had completely forgotten that Brendan Fraser had done a really nice acting job in the fine film ""Gods and Monsters.""

It was made right after Edward G Robinson's breakout performance as Rico in ""Little Caesar"" (The G was for Goldenberg, his real name), and Warner Brothers was anxious to spin off another crime film with Robinson asap. But Robinson was not at all like Rico nor was he interested in making a career as a tough guy, so he demanded changes in the script of ""Smart Money"" to soften his image. The result is a script that shows Nick the Barber (Robinson's character) alternately being sweet and sour, friendly and psychopathic. Robinson occasionally falls into the ""Yeah, that's right sister"" accent that he used so forcefully in ""Little Caesar"" but then reverts to a caring sweet small town barber.Robinson's character is not the only strange part of this film. Early on a woman comes to him and whispers in his ear and Nick hands her $100 bill (making one wonder how a small town barber has a $100 bill in his wallet). She walks up the street and hands the bill to Boris Karloff (an uncredited role even though he speaks several lines) who is lurking in the shadows (where else?), and then Karloff shows up in the back room of the barber shop where Nick and his friends are playing craps.  Nick recognizes the $100 bill, forces Karloff to bet the entire sum, and then kicks him out when he loses. The two scenes make no sense and suggest that several more scenes were cut, which is possible when you consider ""Smart Money"" runs longer than ""Little Caesar"".If these features aren't strange enough, we have Jimmy Cagney playing a supporting role. Cagney shot ""Smart Money"" while he was shooting ""Public Enemy"" and often had to run between the two sets (both were produced at Warners). Once ""Public Enemy"" came out, a few months after ""Smart Money"" debuted, Cagney became a major star and would never appear as a supporting actor again. In fact, even while ""Smart Money"" was being made, the studio knew that Cagney was going to be a huge hit, so they enlarged his part, but they didn't do it seamlessly, so Cagney seems to pop in and out of the film.BTW - the guy who helps Cagney hold up the poker game is Donald Cook, the actor who played Cagney's brother, Mike Powers, in ""Public Enemy"". Cook's role goes uncredited.As a historical film, we have Edward G Robinson, James Cagney, and Boris Karloff at the very starts of their careers (""Frankenstein"" would be released about the same time as ""Public Enemy""), all together in the same scene. Other than this, however, the film tends to be tedious. The ""kinder, gentler"" gangster film unless supporting a comedy usually falls flat, and given such contemporaneous films as ""Scarface"", ""Little Caesar"", and ""Public Enemy"", ""Smart Money"" has tended to be ignored.",2.0,0.8333333333333334,2,2,0.2263,positive,0.9887,very positive,2010,2,17

1231923,B001QOGYFO,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,16,26,2009-09-10,Whiteout Movie Review from The Massie Twins,"While many have found graphic novels to be an excellent template for film adaptations, not all of them translate well to the big screen. Sadly, such is the case with Whiteout, which suffers in everything from the major (lackluster characters, crippling flashback quantities) to the minor (shoddy special effects, blatant continuity errors). As Kate Beckinsale trades fangs and skintight leather for parkas, she also leaves the entertainment value out in the cold. At least the suspense is handled with some care, though the harsh weather is far scarier than the ice-pick wielding villain.A troubled past finds U.S. Marshall Carrie Stetko (Kate Beckinsale) stationed at a remote scientific research facility in Antarctica. With only three days left before the base is plunged into a six-month-long darkness, Stetko is called upon to investigate a mysterious sighting. Uncovering the mutilated body of a scientist, she must race against time to solve the murder before she's trapped with a killer in the coldest, most isolated place in the world.The flashback doesn't have to be a painful storytelling technique, but Whiteout manages to horrifically abuse the tool. In poorly derived moments the film flashes back to the opening scene, to hazy, orange-colored character establishing memories and, in perhaps the most idiotic moment, to less than one minute ago. It's nothing short of staggeringly insulting to the audience. Carrie's history has almost no affect on her ability to catch the killer and is so simple that it could have been summed up in a routine conversation. Early on, the film even misuses fading to black, repeatedly creating a disorienting sense of missing footage.Movies like 30 Days of Night or The Thing have already, more impressively, utilized an abnormally cold setting and toy with the viewer's fears of extreme isolation, distrust and paranoia. In Whiteout, claustrophobia, asphyxiation and being buried alive are also introduced, along with the common, location-specific ""freezing to death."" What isn't so notable is the whiteout of the title, a snowstorm with 100 mph winds that prevent visibility beyond six inches. During the brief scenes dealing with the storm, the lack of sight is frequently anticlimactic, particularly when the blurry, fighting figures are nearly indistinguishable.Director Dominic Sena (Gone in 60 Seconds, Swordfish) must have been exceptionally proud of the special makeup effects department, donating generous amounts of screentime to disturbing shots of badly mutilated bodies. To make up for the grisly images is an immoderately gratuitous shower scene with Beckinsale that somehow produces no inappropriate nudity.

It's coldly calculated to push all the right buttons.In terms of acting, directing, & production values, ""Short Circuit"" is in no way a bad film. The two-star rating is for the way it so blatantly sucks up to the audience's desire for cheaply obtained emotional reactions.""Short Circuit"" is strictly a kiddie film, with little of any real interest to adults.The running commentary (by the director and writers) is one of those rarities -- a generally interesting narrative that largely avoids the self-congratulatory smugness and pointless anecdotes that mar too many commentaries.

87833,0790728354,A2C27IQUH9N1Z,10,14,2003-08-08,Yikes!  Ouch!,"What a mess!  Tolkien wrote 4 books -- The Hobbit and its sequel, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, made up of The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King -- which together tell the story of the resurfacing and the destruction of the One Ring of Power wielded by Middle Earth's evil nemesis, Sauron.  The animated trilogy consists of The Hobbit and two films that should divide the trilogy in half, Lord of the Rings and The Return of the King, though so much material and so many characters are written out that they bear scant resemblance to the source material.  To further complicate matters, The Hobbit and The Return of the King are produced and directed by Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass, the team that brought to television almost every holiday classic that concerns Santa Claus, Frosty, Rudolph or the Easter Bunny, while the second film, The Lord of the Rings, was directed by Raph Bakshi.  Confused yet?  It's important to remember these facts because, other than catering to your need to be comprehensive, you will most likely enjoy Bakshi's effort but should run from the other two as if hellhounds were on your tail.There is so much missing here (including dropping major characters that were in the second instament!) that you will never comprehend the story as written by Tolkien, and even more importantly, the ubiquitous songs are SO plentiful, SO saccharin and SO dated that you may damage your fingers trying to fast forward through them all. DVD extras are slim -- textual screens about Tolkien, Middle Earth and the cast &amp; crew that were on the previous disks.Voice talent is good:  John Huston narrates and plays Gandalf, Orson Bean repeats as Bilbo and Frodo, and Roddy McDowall comes on board as Sam.  Also, the animation of scenery and sets is very good, though weaker with the characters.  Great liberties are taken with Tolkien's material.  Great honking abysmal liberties.The word 'travesty' may be a bit strong, but not by much.  I am generally a forgiving Tolkien fan, and indeed I enjoyed the animated Lord of the Rings directed by Bakshi just fine, but this is drek by a team that treated Tolkien as if he were just Jack Frost with hobbits.  For example, when he runs to Gandalf to let him know that Denethor is attempting suicide, Pippin yells, &quot;He's gone loony I tell ya!&quot;  I don't think you have to be a Tolkien geek to think that's just wrongThis film may appeal to the very young or the very deaf, but for anyone who has read the books, do yourself a favor and steer clear of this song-filled pillage of the 20th century's greatest work of literature.",2.0,0.7142857142857143,2,2,0.0,neutral,0.9927,very positive,2003,8,8
