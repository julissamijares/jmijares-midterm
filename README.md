## Hi! Welcome to my CS506 Midterm Repo from Fall 2024. 

Let me explain some of the files...

feature_analysis.ipynb: This notebook is meant for me (or you) to get a better understanding of the data we are looking at 
and is also used to determine what features will be important to use.

final_model.ipynb: This notebook contains my final model (and two additional models that weren't used), 
and can be run to produce the same output I got. *Please run the feature_analysis first to make sure
every file is up to date.*

Makefile & requirements.txt: This allow the user to run *make install* to download all the packages.

The datasets folder contains all of the datasets I used and you can find out more about each file
in the READ.md located in the datasets folder.
